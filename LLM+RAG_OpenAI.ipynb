TRANSFER OF FUNCTIONS TO THE CHAIRMAN \\n\\nIn addition to the functions transferred by the provi-\\nsions of Reorganization Plan No. 8 of 1950 (64 Stat. 1264) \\n[set out as a note under this section], there are hereby \\ntransferred  from  the  Commission  to  the  Chairman  of \\nthe  Commission  the  functions  of  the  Commission  with \\nrespect to the assignment of Commission personnel, in-\\ncluding  Commissioners,  to  perform  such  functions  as \\nmay  have  been  delegated  by  the  Commission  to  Com-\\nmission  personnel,  including  Commissioners,  pursuant \\nto section 1 of this reorganization plan. \\n\\nMESSAGE OF THE PRESIDENT \\n\\nTo the Congress of the United States: \\n\\nI  transmit  herewith  Reorganization  Plan  No.  4  of \\n1961,  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  Reorganization \\nAct  of  1949,  as  amended,  and  providing  for  reorganiza-\\ntion in the Federal Trade Commission. \\n\\nThis  Reorganization  Plan  No.  4  of  1961  follows  upon \\nmy  message  of  April  13,  1961,  to  the  Congress  of  the \\n\\nUnited  States.  It  is  believed  that  the  taking  effect  of \\nthe  reorganizations  included  in  this  plan  will  provide \\nfor greater efficiency in the dispatch of the business of \\nthe Federal Trade Commission. \\n\\nThe  plan  provides  for  greater  flexibility  in  the  han-\\ndling  of  the  business  before  the  Commission,  permit-\\nting  its  disposition  at  different  levels  so  as  better  to \\npromote its efficient dispatch. Thus matters both of an \\nadjudicatory  and  regulatory  nature  may,  depending \\nupon their importance and their complexity, be finally \\nconsummated  by  divisions  of  the  Commission,  indi-\\nvidual Commissioners, hearing examiners, and, subject \\nto  the  provisions  of  section  7(a)  of  the  Administrative \\nProcedure  Act  (60  Stat.  241),  by  other  employees.  This \\nwill  relieve  the  Commissioners  from  the  necessity  of \\ndealing  with  many  matters  of  lesser  importance  and \\nthus conserve their time for the consideration of major \\nmatters  of  policy  and  planning.  There  is,  however,  re-\\nserved  to  the  Commission  as  a  whole  the  right  to  re-\\nview  any  such  decision,  report  or  certification  either \\nupon its own initiative or upon the petition of a party \\nor  intervenor  demonstrating  to  the  satisfaction  of  the \\nCommission  the  desirability  of  having  the  matter  re-\\nviewed at the top level. \\n\\nProvision is also made, in order to maintain the fun-\\ndamental  bipartisan  concept  explicit  in  the  basic  stat-\\nute  creating  the  Commission,  for  mandatory  review  of \\nany such decision, report or certification upon the vote \\nof a majority of the Commission less one member. \\n\\nInasmuch as the assignment of delegated functions in \\nparticular  cases  and  with  reference  to  particular  prob-\\nlems to divisions of the Commission, to Commissioners, \\nto  hearing  examiners,  to  employees  and  boards  of  em-\\nployees must require continuous and flexible handling, \\ndepending  both  upon  the  amount  and  nature  of  the \\nbusiness,  that  function  is  placed  in  the  Chairman  by \\nsection 2 of the plan. \\n\\nBy providing sound organizational arrangements, the \\ntaking effect of the reorganizations included in the ac-\\ncompanying  reorganization  plan  will  make  possible \\nmore economical and expeditious administration of the \\naffected  functions.  It  is,  however,  impracticable  to \\nitemize  at  this  time  the  reductions  of  expenditures \\nwhich it is probable will be brought about by such tak-\\ning effect. \\n\\nAfter  investigation,  I  have  found  and  hereby  declare \\nthat each reorganization included in the reorganization \\nplan  transmitted  herewith  is  necessary  to  accomplish \\none or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of \\nthe Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended. \\n\\nI recommend that the Congress allow the reorganiza-\\n\\ntion plan to become effective. \\n\\nJOHN F. KENNEDY. \\n\\n§ 42.

Upon request of any party \\nto  such  an  action  against  such  defendant,  the \\ncourt shall also review the determination of law \\nmade  by  the  Commission  in  the  proceeding \\nunder  subsection  (b)  that  the  act  or  practice \\nwhich  was  the  subject  of  such  proceeding  con-\\nstituted an unfair or deceptive act or practice in \\nviolation of subsection (a). \\n\\n(3) The Commission may compromise or settle \\nany  action  for  a  civil  penalty  if  such  com-\\npromise or settlement is accompanied by a pub-\\n\\n\\x0cPage  55\\n\\nTITLE  15—COMMERCE  AND  TRADE\\n\\n§ 45\\n\\nlic  statement  of  its  reasons  and  is  approved  by \\nthe court. \\n(n)  Standard  of  proof;  public  policy  consider-\\n\\nations \\n\\nThe Commission shall have no authority under \\nthis section or section 57a of this title to declare \\nunlawful an act or practice on the grounds that \\nsuch  act  or  practice  is  unfair  unless  the  act  or \\npractice causes or is likely to cause substantial \\ninjury  to  consumers  which  is  not  reasonably \\navoidable by consumers themselves and not out-\\nweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers \\nor  to  competition.  In  determining  whether  an \\nact  or  practice  is  unfair,  the  Commission  may \\nconsider  established  public  policies  as  evidence \\nto  be  considered  with  all  other  evidence.  Such \\npublic  policy  considerations  may  not  serve  as  a \\nprimary basis for such determination. \\n\\n(Sept.  26,  1914,  ch.  311,  § 5,  38  Stat.  719;  Mar.  21, \\n1938, ch. 49, § 3, 52 Stat. 111; June 23, 1938, ch. 601, \\ntitle  XI,  § 1107(f),  52  Stat.  1028;  June  25,  1948,  ch. \\n646, § 32(a), 62 Stat. 991; May 24, 1949, ch. 139, § 127, \\n63  Stat.  107;  Mar.  16,  1950,  ch.  61,  § 4(c),  64  Stat. \\n21; July 14, 1952, ch. 745, § 2, 66 Stat. 632; Pub.

For purposes \\nof  this  section,  a  voluntary  standard  shall  be \\nconsidered  to  be  in  existence  when  it  is  finally \\napproved  by  the  organization  or  other  person \\nwhich  developed  such  standard,  irrespective  of \\nthe effective date of the standard. Before relying \\nupon  any  voluntary  consumer  product  safety \\nstandard, the Commission shall afford interested \\npersons  (including  manufacturers,  consumers, \\nand consumer organizations) a reasonable oppor-\\ntunity  to  submit  written  comments  regarding \\nsuch  standard.  The  Commission  shall  consider \\nsuch  comments  in  making  any  determination \\nregarding  reliance  on  the  involved  voluntary \\nstandard under this subsection. \\n(c)  Publication  of  proposed  rule;  preliminary \\nregulatory  analysis;  contents;  transmittal  of \\nnotice \\n\\nNo  consumer  product  safety  rule  may  be  pro-\\nposed by the Commission unless the Commission \\npublishes in the Federal Register the text of the \\nproposed rule, including any alternatives, which \\nthe  Commission  proposes  to  promulgate,  to-\\ngether  with  a  preliminary  regulatory  analysis \\ncontaining—\\n\\n(1) a preliminary description of the potential \\nbenefits  and  potential  costs  of  the  proposed \\nrule, including any benefits or costs that can-\\nnot  be  quantified  in  monetary  terms,  and  an \\nidentification  of  those  likely  to  receive  the \\nbenefits and bear the costs; \\n\\n(2)  a  discussion  of  the  reasons  any  standard \\nor portion of a standard submitted to the Com-\\nmission  under  subsection  (a)(5)  was  not  pub-\\nlished by the Commission as the proposed rule \\nor part of the proposed rule; \\n\\n(3)  a  discussion  of  the  reasons  for  the  Com-\\nmission’s  preliminary  determination  that  ef-\\nforts  proposed  under  subsection  (a)(6)  and  as-\\nsisted  by  the  Commission  as  required  by  sec-\\ntion 2054(a)(3) of this title would not, within a \\nreasonable  period  of  time,  be  likely  to  result \\nin  the  development  of  a  voluntary  consumer \\nproduct  safety  standard  that  would  eliminate \\nor  adequately  reduce  the  risk  of  injury  ad-\\ndressed by the proposed rule; and \\n\\n(4)  a  description  of  any  reasonable  alter-\\nnatives  to  the  proposed  rule,  together  with  a \\n\\n\\x0cPage  1725\\n\\nTITLE  15—COMMERCE  AND  TRADE\\n\\n§ 2058\\n\\nsummary  description  of  their  potential  costs \\nand  benefits,  and  a  brief  explanation  of  why \\nsuch alternatives should not be published as a \\nproposed rule.\\n\\nThe  Commission  shall  transmit  such  notice \\nwithin  10  calendar  days  to  the  appropriate  Con-\\ngressional  committees.  Any  proposed  consumer \\nproduct safety rule shall be issued within twelve \\nmonths  after  the  date  of  publication  of  the  no-\\ntice,  unless  the  Commission  determines  that \\nsuch  proposed  rule  is  not  reasonably  necessary \\nto eliminate or reduce the risk of injury associ-\\nated with the product or is not in the public in-\\nterest. The Commission may extend the twelve-\\nmonth period for good cause. If the Commission \\nextends such period, it shall immediately trans-\\nmit  notice  of  such  extension  to  the  appropriate \\nCongressional committees. Such notice shall in-\\nclude an explanation of the reasons for such ex-\\ntension,  together  with  an  estimate  of  the  date \\nby which the Commission anticipates such rule-\\nmaking  will  be  completed.  The  Commission \\nshall  publish  notice  of  such  extension  and  the \\ninformation  submitted  to  the  Congress  in  the \\nFederal  Register.  Nothing  in  this  subsection \\nshall  preclude  any  person  from  submitting  an \\nexisting  standard  or  portion  of  a  standard  as  a \\nproposed consumer product safety standard. \\n(d) Promulgation of rule; time \\n\\n(1)  Within  60  days  after  the  publication  under \\nsubsection  (c)  of  a  proposed  consumer  product \\nsafety rule respecting a risk of injury associated \\nwith  a  consumer  product,  the  Commission \\nshall—\\n\\n(A)  promulgate  a  consumer  product  safety \\nrule  respecting  the  risk  of  injury  associated \\nwith such product, if it makes the findings re-\\nquired under subsection (f), or \\n\\n(B)  withdraw  the  applicable  notice  of  pro-\\nposed  rulemaking  if  it  determines  that  such \\nrule  is  not  (i)  reasonably  necessary  to  elimi-\\nnate  or  reduce  an  unreasonable  risk  of  injury \\nassociated with the product, or (ii) in the pub-\\nlic interest;\\n\\nexcept that the Commission may extend such 60-\\nday  period  for  good  cause  shown  (if  it  publishes \\nits reasons therefor in the Federal Register). \\n\\n(2) Consumer product safety rules shall be pro-\\nmulgated in accordance with section 553 of title \\n5,  except  that  the  Commission  shall  give  inter-\\nested persons an opportunity for the oral presen-\\ntation  of  data,  views,  or  arguments,  in  addition \\nto an opportunity to make written submissions. \\nA  transcript  shall  be  kept  of  any  oral  presen-\\ntation. \\n(e)  Expression  of  risk  of  injury;  consideration  of \\navailable  product  data;  needs  of  elderly  and \\nhandicapped \\n\\nA  consumer  product  safety  rule  shall  express \\nin  the  rule  itself  the  risk  of  injury  which  the \\nstandard  is  designed  to  eliminate  or  reduce.  In \\npromulgating  such  a  rule  the  Commission  shall \\nconsider relevant available product data includ-\\ning  the  results  of  research,  development,  test-\\ning,  and  investigation  activities  conducted  gen-\\nerally  and  pursuant  to  this  chapter.  In  the  pro-\\nmulgation  of  such  a  rule  the  Commission  shall \\nalso  consider  and  take  into  account  the  special \\nneeds  of  elderly  and  handicapped  persons  to  de-\\n\\ntermine  the  extent  to  which  such  persons  may \\nbe adversely affected by such rule. \\n\\n(f) Findings; final regulatory analysis; judicial re-\\n\\nview of rule \\n\\n(1)  Prior  to  promulgating  a  consumer  product \\nsafety  rule,  the  Commission  shall  consider,  and \\nshall make appropriate findings for inclusion in \\nsuch rule with respect to—\\n\\n(A)  the  degree  and  nature  of  the  risk  of  in-\\njury  the  rule  is  designed  to  eliminate  or  re-\\nduce; \\n\\n(B)  the  approximate  number  of  consumer \\nproducts,  or  types  or  classes  thereof,  subject \\nto such rule; \\n\\n(C)  the  need  of  the  public  for  the  consumer \\nproducts subject to such rule, and the probable \\neffect  of  such  rule  upon  the  utility,  cost,  or \\navailability  of  such  products  to  meet  such \\nneed; and \\n\\n(D)  any  means  of  achieving  the  objective  of \\nthe  order  while  minimizing  adverse  effects  on \\ncompetition  or  disruption  or  dislocation  of \\nmanufacturing  and  other  commercial  prac-\\ntices  consistent  with  the  public  health  and \\nsafety.\\n\\n(2)  The  Commission  shall  not  promulgate  a \\nconsumer  product  safety  rule  unless  it  has  pre-\\npared,  on  the  basis  of  the  findings  of  the  Com-\\nmission  under  paragraph  (1)  and  on  other  infor-\\nmation  before  the  Commission,  a  final  regu-\\nlatory  analysis  of  the  rule  containing  the  fol-\\nlowing information: \\n\\n(A)  A  description  of  the  potential  benefits \\nand potential costs of the rule, including costs \\nand benefits that cannot be quantified in mon-\\netary  terms,  and  the  identification  of  those \\nlikely  to  receive  the  benefits  and  bear  the \\ncosts. \\n\\n(B)  A  description  of  any  alternatives  to  the \\nfinal  rule  which  were  considered  by  the  Com-\\nmission, together with a summary description \\nof  their  potential  benefits  and  costs  and  a \\nbrief  explanation  of  the  reasons  why  these  al-\\nternatives were not chosen. \\n\\n(C)  A  summary  of  any  significant  issues \\nraised  by  the  comments  submitted  during  the \\npublic comment period in response to the pre-\\nliminary  regulatory  analysis,  and  a  summary \\nof  the  assessment  by  the  Commission  of  such \\nissues.\\n\\nThe  Commission  shall  publish  its  final  regu-\\nlatory analysis with the rule. \\n\\n(3)  The  Commission  shall  not  promulgate  a \\nconsumer  product  safety  rule  unless  it  finds \\n(and includes such finding in the rule)—\\n\\n(A)  that  the  rule  (including  its  effective \\ndate)  is  reasonably  necessary  to  eliminate  or \\nreduce  an  unreasonable  risk  of  injury  associ-\\nated with such product; \\n\\n(B)  that  the  promulgation  of  the  rule  is  in \\n\\nthe public interest; \\n\\n(C)  in  the  case  of  a  rule  declaring  the  prod-\\nuct  a  banned  hazardous  product,  that  no  fea-\\nsible  consumer  product  safety  standard  under \\nthis  chapter  would  adequately  protect  the \\npublic from the unreasonable risk of injury as-\\nsociated with such product; \\n\\n(D)  in  the  case  of  a  rule  which  relates  to  a \\nrisk  of  injury  with  respect  to  which  persons \\n\\n\\x0c§ 2058\\n\\nTITLE  15—COMMERCE  AND  TRADE\\n\\nPage  1726\\n\\nwho would be subject to such rule have adopt-\\ned  and  implemented  a  voluntary  consumer \\nproduct safety standard, that—\\n\\n(i)  compliance  with  such  voluntary  con-\\nsumer  product  safety  standard  is  not  likely \\nto  result  in  the  elimination  or  adequate  re-\\nduction of such risk of injury; or \\n\\n(ii)  it  is  unlikely  that  there  will  be  sub-\\nstantial  compliance  with  such  voluntary \\nconsumer product safety standard;\\n\\n(E)  that  the  benefits  expected  from  the  rule \\nbear a reasonable relationship to its costs; and \\n(F)  that  the  rule  imposes  the  least  burden-\\nsome  requirement  which  prevents  or  ade-\\nquately  reduces  the  risk  of  injury  for  which \\nthe rule is being promulgated.\\n\\n(4)(A)  Any  preliminary  or  final  regulatory \\nanalysis  prepared  under  subsection  (c)  or  (f)(2) \\nshall  not  be  subject  to  independent  judicial  re-\\nview, except that when an action for judicial re-\\nview  of  a  rule  is  instituted,  the  contents  of  any \\nsuch regulatory analysis shall constitute part of \\nthe whole rulemaking record of agency action in \\nconnection with such review. \\n\\n(B)  The  provisions  of  subparagraph  (A)  shall \\nnot be construed to alter the substantive or pro-\\ncedural  standards  otherwise  applicable  to  judi-\\ncial review of any action by the Commission. \\n(g) Effective date of rule or standard; stockpiling \\n\\nof product \\n\\n(1)  Each  consumer  product  safety  rule  shall \\nspecify  the  date  such  rule  is  to  take  effect  not \\nexceeding  180  days  from  the  date  promulgated, \\nunless  the  Commission  finds,  for  good  cause \\nshown, that a later effective date is in the public \\ninterest  and  publishes  its  reasons  for  such  find-\\ning.  The  effective  date  of  a  consumer  product \\nsafety  standard  under  this  chapter  shall  be  set \\nat  a  date  at  least  30  days  after  the  date  of  pro-\\nmulgation unless the Commission for good cause \\nshown  determines  that  an  earlier  effective  date \\nis  in  the  public  interest.  In  no  case  may  the  ef-\\nfective  date  be  set  at  a  date  which  is  earlier \\nthan  the  date  of  promulgation.  A  consumer \\nproduct safety standard shall be applicable only \\nto consumer products manufactured after the ef-\\nfective date. \\n\\n(2)  The  Commission  may  by  rule  prohibit  a \\nmanufacturer of a consumer product from stock-\\npiling any product to which a consumer product \\nsafety rule applies, or to which a rule under this \\nchapter or similar rule, regulation, standard, or \\nban  under  any  other  Act  enforced  by  the  Com-\\nmission  applies,  so  as  to  prevent  such  manufac-\\nturer  from  circumventing  the  purpose  of  such \\nrule,  regulation,  standard,  or  ban.  For  purposes \\nof this paragraph, the term ‘‘stockpiling’’ means \\nmanufacturing  or  importing  a  product  between \\nthe  date  of  promulgation  of  such  rule,  regula-\\ntion, standard, or ban and its effective date at a \\nrate  which  is  significantly  greater  (as  deter-\\nmined under the rule under this paragraph) than \\nthe rate at which such product was produced or \\nimported during a base period (prescribed in the \\nrule  under  this  paragraph)  ending  before  the \\ndate  of  promulgation  of  the  rule,  regulation, \\nstandard, or ban. \\n(h) Amendment or revocation of rule \\n\\nThe Commission may by rule amend or revoke \\nany consumer product safety rule. Such amend-\\n\\nment  or  revocation  shall  specify  the  date  on \\nwhich it is to take effect which shall not exceed \\n180  days  from  the  date  the  amendment  or  rev-\\nocation  is  published  unless  the  Commission \\nfinds for good cause shown that a later effective \\ndate  is  in  the  public  interest  and  publishes  its \\nreasons  for  such  finding.  Where  an  amendment \\ninvolves  a  material  change  in  a  consumer  prod-\\nuct  safety  rule,  sections  2056  and  2057  of  this \\ntitle, and subsections (a) through (g) of this sec-\\ntion  shall  apply.  In  order  to  revoke  a  consumer \\nproduct  safety  rule,  the  Commission  shall  pub-\\nlish  a  proposal  to  revoke  such  rule  in  the  Fed-\\neral Register, and allow oral and written presen-\\ntations  in  accordance  with  subsection  (d)(2)  of \\nthis  section.  It  may  revoke  such  rule  only  if  it \\ndetermines  that  the  rule  is  not  reasonably  nec-\\nessary  to  eliminate  or  reduce  an  unreasonable \\nrisk  of  injury  associated  with  the  product.  Sec-\\ntion 2060 of this title shall apply to any amend-\\nment  of  a  consumer  product  safety  rule  which \\ninvolves  a  material  change  and  to  any  revoca-\\ntion  of  a  consumer  product  safety  rule,  in  the \\nsame  manner  and  to  the  same  extent  as  such \\nsection  applies  to  the  Commission’s  action  in \\npromulgating such a rule. \\n(i) Petition to initiate rulemaking \\n\\nThe  Commission  shall  grant,  in  whole  or  in \\npart, or deny any petition under section 553(e) of \\ntitle  5  requesting  the  Commission  to  initiate  a \\nrulemaking,  within  a  reasonable  time  after  the \\ndate  on  which  such  petition  is  filed.  The  Com-\\nmission  shall  state  the  reasons  for  granting  or \\ndenying such petition. The Commission may not \\ndeny  any  such  petition  on  the  basis  of  a  vol-\\nuntary  standard  unless  the  voluntary  standard \\nis  in  existence  at  the  time  of  the  denial  of  the \\npetition,  the  Commission  has  determined  that \\nthe voluntary standard is likely to result in the \\nelimination or adequate reduction of the risk of \\ninjury identified in the petition, and it is likely \\nthat  there  will  be  substantial  compliance  with \\nthe standard. \\n\\n(Pub.

During  the  45-day \\nperiod  beginning  on  July  11,  1978,  the  Commis-\\nsion may make, and shall publish in the Federal \\nRegister, \\nnonsubstantive \\ntechnical, \\nchanges in such requirements as it deems appro-\\npriate  to  make  such  requirements  suitable  for \\npromulgation  as  a  consumer  product  safety \\nstandard.  At  the  end  of  the  60-day  period  speci-\\nfied  in  the  first  sentence  of  this  paragraph,  the \\nCommission  shall  publish  in  the  Federal  Reg-\\nister  such  interim  consumer  product  safety \\nstandard,  as  altered  by  the  Commission  under \\nthis paragraph. \\n\\nsuch \\n\\n(2)  The  interim  consumer  product  safety \\nstandard  established  in  paragraph  (1)  shall  pro-\\nvide  that  any  cellulose  insulation  which  is  pro-\\nduced  or  distributed  for  sale  or  use  as  a  con-\\nsumer  product  shall  have  a  flame  spread  rating \\nof 0 to 25, as such rating is set forth in the Gen-\\neral  Services  Administration’s  specification  for \\ncellulose insulation, HH–I–515C. \\n\\n(3)  During  the  period  for  which  the  interim \\nconsumer product safety standard established in \\nsubsection  (a)  is  in  effect,  in  addition  to  com-\\nplying  with  any  labeling  requirement  estab-\\nlished  by  the  Commission  under  this  chapter, \\neach  manufacturer  or  private  labeler  of  cel-\\nlulose  insulation  shall  include  the  following \\nstatement on any container of such cellulose in-\\nsulation:  ‘‘ATTENTION:  This  material  meets \\nthe  applicable  minimum  Federal  flammability \\nstandard.  This  standard  is  based  upon  labora-\\ntory  tests  only,  which  do  not  represent  actual \\nconditions which may occur in the home’’. Such \\nstatement  shall  be  located  in  a  conspicuous \\nplace on such container and shall appear in con-\\nspicuous  and  legible  type  in  contrast  by  typog-\\nraphy, layout, and color with other printed mat-\\nter on such container. \\n(b) Scope of judicial review \\n\\nJudicial review of the interim consumer prod-\\nuct  safety  standard  established  in  subsection \\n(a), as such standard is in effect on and after the \\nlast  day  of  the  60-day  period  specified  in  such \\nsubsection, shall be limited solely to the issue of \\nwhether  any  changes  made  by  the  Commission \\nunder  paragraph  (1)  are  technical,  nonsub-\\nstantive  changes.  For  purposes  of  such  review, \\n\\nany  change  made  by  the  Commission  under \\nparagraph (1) which requires that any test to de-\\ntermine  the  flame  spread  rating  of  cellulose  in-\\nsulation shall include a correction for variations \\nin  test  results  caused  by  equipment  used  in  the \\ntest  shall  be  considered  a  technical,  nonsub-\\nstantive change. \\n(c)  Enforcement;  violations;  promulgation  of \\nfinal  standard;  procedures  applicable  to  pro-\\nmulgation;  revision  of  interim  standard;  pro-\\ncedures applicable to revision \\n\\n(1)(A)  Any  interim  consumer  product  safety \\nstandard  established  pursuant  to  this  section \\nshall  be  enforced  in  the  same  manner  as  any \\nother  consumer  product  safety  standard  until \\nsuch  time  as  there  is  in  effect  a  final  consumer \\nproduct  safety  standard  promulgated  by  the \\nCommission, as provided in subparagraph (B), or \\nuntil such time as it is revoked by the Commis-\\nsion  under  section  2058(e)  of  this  title.  A  viola-\\ntion  of  the  interim  consumer  product  safety \\nstandard  shall  be  deemed  to  be  a  violation  of  a \\nconsumer  product  safety  standard  promulgated \\nby  the  Commission  under  section  2058  of  this \\ntitle. \\n\\n(B) If the Commission determines that the in-\\nterim  consumer  product  safety  standard  does \\nnot  adequately  protect  the  public  from  the  un-\\nreasonable  risk  of  injury  associated  with  flam-\\nmable  or  corrosive  cellulose  insulation,  it  shall \\npromulgate  a  final  consumer  product  safety \\nstandard to protect against such risk. Such final \\nstandard  shall  be  promulgated  pursuant  to  sec-\\ntion  553  of  title  5,  except  that  the  Commission \\nshall  give  interested  persons  an  opportunity  for \\nthe  oral  presentation  of  data,  views,  or  argu-\\nments,  in  addition  to  an  opportunity  to  make \\nwritten  submissions.  A  transcript  shall  be  kept \\nof  any  oral  presentation.  The  provisions  of  sec-\\ntion  2058(b),  (c),  and  (d)  of  this  title  shall  apply \\nto  any  proceeding  to  promulgate  such  final \\nstandard.  In  any  judicial  review  of  such  final \\nstandard  under  section  2060  of  this  title,  the \\ncourt  shall  not  require  any  demonstration  that \\neach particular finding made by the Commission \\nunder section 2058(c) of this title is supported by \\nsubstantial evidence. The court shall affirm the \\naction of the Commission unless the court deter-\\nmines that such action is not supported by sub-\\nstantial  evidence  on  the  record  taken  as  a \\nwhole. \\n\\n(2)(A) Until there is in effect such a final con-\\nsumer  product  safety  standard,  the  Commission \\nshall  incorporate  into  the  interim  consumer \\nproduct safety standard, in accordance with the \\nprovisions  of  this  paragraph,  each  revision  su-\\nperseding  the  requirements  for  flame  resistance \\nand  corrosiveness  referred  to  in  subsection  (a) \\nand  promulgated  by  the  General  Services  Ad-\\nministration. \\n\\n(B) At least 45 days before any revision super-\\nseding such requirements is to become effective, \\nthe  Administrator  of  the  General  Services  Ad-\\nministration  shall  notify  the  Commission  of \\nsuch  revision.  In  the  case  of  any  such  revision \\nwhich becomes effective during the period begin-\\nning on February 1, 1978, and ending on July 11, \\n1978,  such  notice  from  the  Administrator  of  the \\nGeneral  Services  Administration \\nshall  be \\ndeemed to have been made on July 11, 1978. \\n\\n\\x0cPage  1763\\n\\nTITLE  15—COMMERCE  AND  TRADE\\n\\n§ 2082\\n\\n(C)(i) No later than 45 days after receiving any \\nnotice  under  subparagraph  (B),  the  Commission \\nincluding  such \\nshall  publish  the  revision, \\nchanges  in  the  revision  as  it  considers  appro-\\npriate to make the revision suitable for promul-\\ngation  as  an  amendment  to  the  interim  con-\\nsumer  product  safety  standard,  in  the  Federal \\nRegister  as  a  proposed  amendment  to  the  in-\\nterim consumer product safety standard. \\n\\n(ii) The Commission may extend the 45-day pe-\\nriod  specified  in  clause  (i)  for  an  additional  pe-\\nriod of not more than 150 days if the Commission \\ndetermines  that  such  extension  is  necessary  to \\nstudy  the  technical  and  scientific  basis  for  the \\nrevision  involved,  or  to  study  the  safety  and \\neconomic consequences of such revision. \\n\\n(D)(i)  Additional  extensions  of  the  45-day  pe-\\nriod  specified  in  subparagraph  (C)(i)  may  be \\ntaken by the Commission if—\\n\\n(I) the Commission makes the determination \\nrequired  in  subparagraph  (C)(ii)  with  respect \\nto each such extension;

Findings and purposes \\n\\n(a)  The  Congress  finds  and  declares  the  fol-\\n\\nlowing: \\n\\n(1)  The  future  well-being  of  the  United \\nStates economy depends on a strong manufac-\\nturing  base  and  requires  continual  improve-\\nments  in  manufacturing  technology,  quality \\ncontrol,  and  techniques  for  ensuring  product \\nreliability and cost-effectiveness. \\n\\n(2)  Precise  measurements,  calibrations,  and \\nstandards  help  United  States  industry  and \\nmanufacturing  concerns  compete  strongly  in \\nworld markets. \\n\\n(3)  Improvements  in  manufacturing  and \\nproduct  technology  depend  on  fundamental \\nscientific  and  engineering  research  to  develop \\n(A)  the  precise  and  accurate  measurement \\nmethods  and  measurement  standards  needed \\nto improve quality and reliability, and (B) new \\ntechnological  processes  by  which  such  im-\\nproved methods may be used in practice to im-\\nprove manufacturing and to assist industry to \\ntransfer important laboratory discoveries into \\ncommercial products. \\n\\n(4)  Scientific  progress,  public  safety,  and \\nproduct  compatibility  and  standardization \\nalso  depend  on  the  development  of  precise \\nmeasurement  methods,  standards,  and  related \\nbasic technologies. \\n\\n(5)  The  National  Bureau  of  Standards  since \\nits  establishment  has  served  as  the  Federal \\nfocal  point  in  developing  basic  measurement \\nstandards  and  related  technologies,  has  taken \\na  lead  role  in  stimulating  cooperative  work \\namong  private  industrial  organizations  in  ef-\\nforts  to  surmount  technological  hurdles,  and \\notherwise has been responsible for assisting in \\nthe improvement of industrial technology. \\n\\n(6) The Federal Government should maintain \\na  national  science,  engineering,  and  tech-\\nnology  laboratory  which  provides  measure-\\nment methods, standards, and associated tech-\\nnologies and which aids United States compa-\\nnies  in  using  new  technologies  to  improve \\nproducts and manufacturing processes. \\n\\n\\x0cPage  651\\n\\nTITLE  15—COMMERCE  AND  TRADE\\n\\n§ 271\\n\\n(7)  Such  national  laboratory  also  should \\nserve industry, trade associations, State tech-\\nnology  programs,  labor  organizations,  profes-\\nsional  societies,  and  educational  institutions \\nby  disseminating  information  on  new  basic \\ntechnologies  including  automated  manufac-\\nturing processes.\\n\\n(b) It is the purpose of this chapter—\\n\\n(1) to rename the National Bureau of Stand-\\nards  as  the  National  Institute  of  Standards \\nand Technology and to modernize and restruc-\\nture that agency to augment its unique ability \\nto  enhance  the  competitiveness  of  American \\nindustry  while  maintaining  its  traditional \\nfunction  as  lead  national  laboratory  for  pro-\\nviding  the  measurements,  calibrations,  and \\nquality  assurance  techniques  which  underpin \\nUnited  States \\ntechnological \\nprogress,  improved  product  reliability  and \\nmanufacturing processes, and public safety; \\n\\ncommerce, \\n\\n(2) to assist private sector initiatives to cap-\\n\\nitalize on advanced technology; \\n\\n(3)  to  advance,  through  cooperative  efforts \\namong  industries,  universities,  and  govern-\\nment laboratories, promising research and de-\\nvelopment projects, which can be optimized by \\nthe  private  sector  for  commercial  and  indus-\\ntrial applications; and \\n\\n(4)  to  promote  shared  risks,  accelerated  de-\\nvelopment, and pooling of skills which will be \\nnecessary  to  strengthen  America’s  manufac-\\nturing industries. \\n\\n(Mar.  3,  1901,  ch.  872,  § 1,  31  Stat.  1449;  Pub.

Below is a\\nlist of various ways we enforce policies, without limiting Google\\'s rights under applicable law.\\n\\nServices suspension\\n\\nWe may suspend businesses or other entities from using the Communication Service(s) if they\\nviolate our product policies. This means that the suspended business or entity can no longer\\nuse Communication Service(s) until the problem is \\x00xed and has passed a policy review.\\n\\nAccount suspension\\n\\nWe may suspend your account if you have several violations or a serious violation.

Failure to comply with the requirements in the Communication Services\\ndocumentation will be considered a material violation of this policy.\\n\\nYou may change the content of a registered agent throughout its lifecycle if the change is\\nconsistent with the registered agent use case category and user consent. However, if you\\nmake changes, you must \\x00rst notify the approver in writing (email to su\\x00ce) for reapproval (at\\n\\nthe approver’s sole option), of all changes to an agent (including the updated versions of\\nconsent validity, agent information, and content) before such changes may be implemented.\\n\\nYou may only have one agent delivering the same content (e.g., promotional campaign for XYZ\\n\\nCompany’s new product) to the same user, even if you use multiple developers. It is your\\nbrands’ and developers’ responsibility to adhere to brand and agent level business rules\\ndescribed in the Communication Services documentation.\\n\\nAgent Suspension\\n\\nIn addition to the other remedies Google may pursue, we may immediately suspend an agent if\\n\\nwe become aware of a violation of our Communication Services policies. The agent may be\\nreactivated if you establish the agent’s compliance with our Communication Services policies\\nwithin a reasonable timeframe of such agent being noncompliant. If you have a suspended\\nagent(s), Google will not approve any additional agent(s) until all suspended agent(s) are\\n\\ncorrected (according to the Communication Services documentation and any other\\nrequirements provided by Google) and reactivated by Google following such correction. If the\\npartner fails to correct a noncompliant agent(s) within the required timeframe and/or has\\n\\nmultiple agent noncompliance violations, we may immediately suspend your account and all of\\ntheir agents without any warning.\\n\\nhttps://developers.google.com/business-communications/support/aup\\n\\n11/12\\n\\n\\x0c4/28/24, 11:19 AM\\n\\nAcceptable Use Policy  |  Business Communications  |  Google for Developers\\n\\nExcept as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License\\n\\xa0(https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), and code samples are licensed under the Apache 2.0 License\\n\\xa0(https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

Our Business Conduct Policy is \\nfoundational to how we do business and how we put our values into practice each and every day.\\n\\nApple conducts business ethically, honestly, and in full compliance with applicable laws and \\nregulations. This applies to every business decision in every area of the company worldwide.\\n\\nThe following principles guide Apple’s business practices:\\n\\n•   Honesty—Demonstrate honesty and high ethical standards in all business dealings.\\n\\n•   Respect—Treat customers, partners, suppliers, employees, and others with respect and courtesy. \\n\\n•   Confidentiality—Protect Apple’s confidential information and the information of our customers, partners, suppliers, and \\n\\nemployees.\\n\\n•   Compliance—Ensure that business decisions comply with applicable laws and regulations.\\n\\nApple expects its suppliers, contractors, consultants, and other business partners to follow these principles when providing \\n\\ngoods and services to Apple or acting on our behalf. Apple also requires its suppliers to comply with the Apple Supplier \\n\\nCode of Conduct.\\n\\nThe Business Conduct Policy applies to all full and part-time employees of Apple and its subsidiaries, and provides a \\n\\nstandard guide for what is required of everyone at Apple. Relevant sections also apply to members of Apple’s Board of \\n\\nDirectors. The Business Conduct Policy also provides information on additional resources available to employees, including \\n\\nthe Business Conduct Helpline and the Business Conduct website, which contains guidance and frequently asked \\n\\nquestions to assist employees in understanding Apple’s approach to Business Conduct. \\n\\nAll employees are required to complete annual, online Business Conduct training, and review and certify their \\n\\nunderstanding of the Business Conduct Policy. Employees are also required to complete online Respect at Apple and \\n\\nPrivacy trainings, and depending on job responsibilities and location, may be required to participate in additional mandatory \\n\\nonline trainings on specific topics, such as anti-corruption. Focused live training is also arranged periodically on Business \\n\\nConduct and other relevant topics.\\n\\nOn rare occasions, local laws may impose requirements on Apple and its employees that differ from those set\\xa0out in the \\n\\nBusiness Conduct Policy. Contact a local People Business Partner for more information on how these laws may apply to \\n\\nyou. \\n\\nAny waiver of this Policy for our directors, executive officers, or principal accounting officer may be made only by our Board \\n\\nof Directors, and will be disclosed as required by law or applicable listing rules.\\n\\n 3\\n\\nBusiness ConductFebruary 2024\\x0cIntroduction\\n\\nBehaviors\\n\\nProtecting Apple\\n\\nAccountability\\n\\nIntegrity\\n\\nResources\\n\\nYour Responsibilities and Obligation to Take Action\\n\\nEverything we do is a reflection of Apple.

If you see or hear of any violation of Apple’s Business Conduct Policy, other Apple policies, or legal or \\nregulatory requirements, you must notify either your manager, People Team, Legal, or Business Conduct. \\n•   Use good judgment and ask questions. Apply Apple’s principles of business conduct, and review our policies and legal \\n\\nrequirements. When in doubt about how to proceed, discuss it with your manager, your People Business Partner, Legal, \\n\\nor Business Conduct. Any failure to comply with Apple’s Business Conduct Policy—or failure to report a violation—may \\n\\nresult in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.\\n\\nYou are also required to fully cooperate in any Apple investigation, and keep any information shared with you confidential to \\n\\nsafeguard the integrity of the investigation.\\n\\nReporting a Concern\\n\\nTo report a concern or ask a question about Apple’s Business Conduct Policy, you can contact Business Conduct by phone, \\n\\nemail, or web form. For contact details, visit the Business Conduct website or the Resources section at the end of this \\n\\npolicy. Apple’s external helpline (apple.ethicspoint.com) also allows employees and external parties to report concerns with \\n\\nthe option of remaining anonymous, where permissible under applicable laws. The external helpline provides local, toll-free \\n\\nphone numbers that connect employees and external parties to a multilingual reporting service.\\n\\nYour information will be shared only with those who have a need to know to help answer your questions or investigate \\n\\nconcerns, ensure the prompt enforcement of this Policy, and, if appropriate, determine disciplinary action. If your \\n\\ninformation involves accounting, finance, or auditing, the law may require that necessary information be shared with the \\n\\nAudit and\\xa0Finance Committee of the Board of Directors. Apple’s Business Conduct Policy is administered by the Business \\n\\nConduct organization, under the oversight of Apple’s Chief Compliance Officer, who provides regular updates to the Audit \\n\\nand Finance Committee of the Board of Directors. The Business Conduct team is available to support all employees and \\n\\nanswer questions on business conduct issues, policies, regulations, and compliance with legal requirements. \\n\\nApple’s Global Whistleblowing Policy provides additional information about Apple’s approach to protecting and supporting \\n\\nindividuals who report potential misconduct.\\n\\nNo Retaliation\\n\\nApple will not retaliate—and will not tolerate retaliation—against any individual for reporting a good-faith concern or \\n\\ncomplaint internally or externally or for participating in the investigation of a concern or complaint. \\n\\nRetaliation under this policy occurs when Apple or one of its employees takes an action adversely affecting the career, pay, \\n\\nscope of role, or working conditions of an individual because the individual:\\n\\n•   Reported or participated in the investigation of a potential violation of our policies or the law; or\\n\\n•  Engaged in legally protected activity, including related to leaves of absence or job accommodations, or forming or joining \\n\\n(or refraining from joining) labor organizations of an employee’s choice in a lawful manner.\\n\\nIn addition to violating this policy, some instances of retaliation may be unlawful.\\n\\n 4\\n\\nBusiness ConductFebruary 2024\\x0cIntroduction\\n\\nBehaviors\\n\\nProtecting Apple\\n\\nAccountability\\n\\nIntegrity\\n\\nResources\\n\\nOther behaviors that dissuade people from raising concerns or asking questions about complying with Apple’s policies or \\n\\nlegal obligations are also unacceptable under this policy and other Apple policies.\\n\\nYour Rights as an Employee\\n\\nYou are permitted to speak freely about your wages, hours, and working conditions, including information about \\n\\nharassment, discrimination, or any other conduct you have reason to believe is unlawful, and nothing in this Policy, or any \\n\\nApple policy, should be interpreted as being restrictive of your right to do so.  \\n\\nHuman Rights\\n\\nApple is committed to respecting internationally recognized human rights.

Being aware of where you are, who is around you, and what they might see or overhear is an \\n\\nimportant way we all protect Apple’s secrets.\\n\\n•  Protect our assets. Keep track of the assets and information Apple has entrusted to you, and prevent loss, misuse, \\n\\nwaste, or theft.\\n\\n•  Set an example. Model behavior that protects our assets and information at all times.\\n\\nApple Confidential Information\\n\\nOne of our greatest assets is information about our products and services, including future product offerings. Never \\n\\ndisclose confidential, operational, financial, trade-secret, or other business information without verifying with your \\n\\nmanager whether such disclosure is\\xa0appropriate. We are very selective when disclosing this type of information to vendors, \\n\\nsuppliers, or other third parties, and only do so once a non-disclosure agreement is in place. Even within Apple, confidential \\n\\ninformation should only be shared on a need-to-know basis. The Intellectual Property Agreement that you signed when \\n\\nyou joined Apple outlines your duty to protect our information. \\n\\nFor more information, visit the Global Security website. \\n\\nNon-Disclosure/Confidentiality Agreements\\n\\nNever share confidential information about Apple’s products or services without your manager’s approval. When there is \\n\\na business need to share confidential information with a supplier, vendor, or other third party, never volunteer more than \\n\\nwhat is necessary to address the business at hand. Any confidential information shared outside Apple should be covered \\n\\nby a non-disclosure/confidentiality agreement (NDA). To learn more about NDAs and the NDA process, visit Legal’s NDA \\n\\nwebsite.\\n\\nCustomer and Third-Party Information\\n\\nCustomers, partners, suppliers, and other third parties may disclose confidential information to Apple during the course \\n\\nof business. We are all responsible for protecting and maintaining the confidentiality of any information entrusted to us by \\n\\nour partners. Compromising that trust may damage relations with our partners and can also result in legal liability. For more \\n\\ninformation, see the Apple Customer Privacy Policy. \\n\\nAccuracy of Records and Reports\\n\\nAccurate and honest records are critical to meeting our legal, financial, and management obligations. You should ensure \\n\\nthat all records and reports, including expense reports, timecards, customer information, technical and product information, \\n\\ncorrespondence, and public communications are comprehensive, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable. \\n\\nDo not misstate facts, omit critical information, or modify records or reports in any way to\\xa0mislead others, and never assist \\n\\nothers in doing so. Intentional manipulation of Apple records is a form of fraud.\\n\\n 7\\n\\nBusiness ConductFebruary 2024\\x0cIntroduction\\n\\nBehaviors\\n\\nProtecting Apple\\n\\nAccountability\\n\\nIntegrity\\n\\nResources\\n\\nYou are responsible for observing all policies and procedures regarding business expenses, including meal and travel \\n\\nexpenses, and for submitting accurate expense reimbursement reports. Guidelines on daily meal expenses vary worldwide. \\n\\nFor more information, see the Travel and Expense Policy. \\n\\nRecords and Information Management\\n\\nApple owns all records and information in any form, such as electronic or paper, that is created or received in the course \\n\\nof doing Apple’s business. Records are a type of information that must be kept because the information meets certain \\n\\ncriteria, and are identified in the Global Records Retention Schedule. Examples include corporate tax documents, financial \\n\\nstatements, design documents, and personnel records. \\n\\nEmployees are responsible for managing and protecting information and records in accordance with the Global Records \\n\\nand Information Management (RIM) Policy. Privacy laws may dictate how long these records can be retained. At times, \\n\\nApple will need to retain records and information beyond the normal retention period for legal reasons or audits. If you have \\n\\nrecords and information that are categorized as under a “legal hold” you should not alter, destroy, or delete them in any \\n\\nway. Legal will notify you of any legal holds you may be subjected to and what is required.\\n\\nFor more information, see the Global Records & Information Management website or contact the Global Records & Infor-\\n\\nmation Management team.  \\n\\nSide Deals or Side Letters\\n\\nApple formally documents all terms and conditions of the agreements into which it enters. Contractual terms and \\n\\nconditions define Apple’s rights, obligations, liabilities, and accounting treatments. We do not accept business \\n\\ncommitments outside of the formal contracting process managed by Legal. Side deals, side letters, or other informal \\n\\ndocumentation created by employees without Legal oversight are impermissible. You should not make any oral or written \\n\\ncommitments that create a new agreement or modify an existing agreement without securing approval through the formal \\n\\ncontracting process.\\n\\nThe Apple Identity and Trademarks\\n\\nThe Apple name, names of products (such as iPhone), names of services (such as AppleCare), taglines (such as ”Think \\n\\nDifferent”), and logos collectively create the Apple identity. Before publicly using any of these assets, review the Trademark \\n\\nList, Trademark and Copyright Guidelines, and Corporate Identity Guidelines for how to properly do so. You should also \\n\\ncheck with Legal before using the product names, service names, taglines, or logos of any third parties.\\n\\nThird-Party Intellectual Property\\n\\nApple respects third-party intellectual property. Never use the intellectual property of any third party without permission \\n\\nor legal right. If you are told or suspect that Apple may be infringing on third-party intellectual property, including patents, \\n\\ncopyrights, trademarks, or trade secrets, contact Legal.\\n\\n 8\\n\\nBusiness ConductFebruary 2024\\x0cIntroduction\\n\\nBehaviors\\n\\nProtecting Apple\\n\\nAccountability\\n\\nIntegrity\\n\\nResources\\n\\nCopyright-Protected Content \\n\\nNever use or copy software, music, videos, publications, or other copyright-protected content at work or for business \\n\\npurposes unless you or Apple are legally permitted to use or make copies of the protected content. You should never use \\n\\nApple facilities or equipment to make or store unauthorized copies. For more information about personal content on Apple-\\n\\nowned devices, see the Employee Use of Electronic Systems and Communications Policy. \\n\\nApple Inventions, Patents and Copyrights\\n\\nApple has a robust patent program that protects innovations related to our current or future products and services. You \\n\\nshould submit your invention disclosure to the Apple Patent team via the Apple Patent System. It’s best to submit your \\n\\ninvention disclosure well before you share an invention outside of Apple, even if under an NDA, because doing so may \\n\\ncompromise Apple’s patent rights. \\n\\nYou may pursue, for your own personal ownership, inventions that (a) are not developed using Apple equipment, supplies, \\n\\nfacilities, or proprietary information; (b) did not result from and were not suggested by work performed by you, Apple, or \\n\\nApple proprietary information; and (c) are not related to Apple’s current or anticipated business, products, research or \\n\\ndevelopment.\\n\\nBe alert to possible infringement of Apple’s patents and notify Legal of any possible infringements. If you create original \\n\\nmaterial for Apple that requires copyright protection, such as software, place Apple’s copyright notice on the work and \\n\\nsubmit a copyright disclosure form to Legal. For more information, see the Copyright Policy.\\n\\nActivities Related to Technical Standards\\n\\nYou must secure management and Legal approval before participating in any activities related to technical standards. \\n\\nThis includes joining a standards organization or working group, contributing technology or code to a standard, or using \\n\\na standard in the development of an Apple product. For more information, see the Standards Legal Policy or contact the \\n\\nStandards Legal team.\\n\\nActivities Related to Open Source Software\\n\\nOpen source software is usually collectively developed software with its source code made available under an open source \\n\\nlicense. Before using, modifying, or distributing any open source software for Apple infrastructure, or as part of an Apple \\n\\nproduct or service development effort, you must receive management and Legal approval. For additional information on \\n\\nhow to submit requests, visit Open Source at Apple. This website also includes information about personal contributions to \\n\\nOpen Source and required approvals.\\n\\nPublic Speaking and Press Inquiries\\n\\nAll public or outside speaking engagements that relate to Apple’s business, products, or services must be pre-approved \\n\\nby your manager and Corporate Communications. If your request is approved, you may not request or accept any form of \\n\\npersonal compensation from the organization that requested your participation, but you may accept reimbursement for \\n\\nincurred expenses.

Avoid any\\xa0situation that creates a real or perceived conflict of interest. If\\xa0you are unsure \\n\\nabout a potential conflict, talk to your manager, Business Conduct, or your People Business Partner. \\n\\nMembers of Apple’s Board of Directors should follow the requirements and procedures described in the Guidelines \\n\\nRegarding Director Conflicts of Interest.\\n\\nThe following are common situations employees may encounter that could present a conflict of interest.\\n\\nSignificant Personal Relationships \\n\\nPersonal relationships in the workplace can present a real or perceived conflict of interest when one individual \\n\\nin the relationship makes or influences employment decisions regarding the other, including performance or \\n\\ncompensation. \\n\\nSignificant personal relationships include, but are not limited to, spouses, domestic partners, family members, \\n\\ndating or physical relationships, close friends, and business relationships outside of Apple. Apple business \\n\\nrelationships include, but are not limited to, vendors, customers, suppliers, contractors, temporary agency \\n\\nworkers, or similar relationships.\\n\\nDo not conduct Apple business with family members or others with whom you have a\\xa0significant personal \\n\\nrelationship. Do not use your position at Apple to obtain favored treatment for yourself, family members, or \\n\\nothers with whom you have a personal relationship. This applies to\\xa0product purchases or sales, investment \\n\\nopportunities, hiring, promoting, selecting contractors or suppliers, and any other business matter. \\n\\nIf you believe that you\\xa0have a potential conflict involving a family member or other individual, disclose it\\xa0to your \\n\\nmanager and your People Business Partner to review and work through any potential conflicts. \\n\\nYou should not allow any relationship to disrupt the workplace or interfere with your work or judgment.\\n\\nIn rare cases where exceptions may be appropriate, written approval from the senior vice president of your \\n\\norganization is required.  \\n\\nRotations (Operations Only) \\n\\nOperations managers are responsible for ensuring that their employees who make or significantly influence \\n\\nsourcing, contractual, financial or capacity decisions with suppliers change position every three years so as to \\n\\nwork with different suppliers. Exceptions are subject to VP review and approval each year. “Suppliers” include \\n\\nanyone who had, has, or might have any business connection (directly or indirectly) with Apple or Apple’s \\n\\nsupply chain.\\n\\nConflicts of Interest and Outside Activities \\n\\nYou may participate in outside activities, including secondary employment, businesses, inventions, and serving \\n\\non boards, only if they do not present a conflict of interest and you adhere to the rules set out below.\\n\\n 11\\n\\nBusiness ConductFebruary 2024\\x0cIntroduction\\n\\nBehaviors\\n\\nProtecting Apple\\n\\nAccountability\\n\\nIntegrity\\n\\nResources\\n\\nApple generally considers an outside activity to be a conflict of interest if it:  \\n\\n•  Is for a business, company, or organization that makes or sells competing products or services to Apple, or \\n\\nthat Apple is reasonably anticipated to create. This includes but is not limited to: Apple hardware products \\n\\n(e.g., computers, mobile devices, headphones), financial services, original content, health services, cloud \\n\\nservices, any distribution of video, music or eBooks, and any software or app.\\n\\n•  Generates or exposes you to intellectual property that competes with or relates to Apple’s present or \\n\\nreasonably anticipated business, products, or services.\\n\\n•  Would require you to disclose or use confidential Apple information.\\n\\n•  Arises from your role in Apple’s business relationship with the organization.\\n\\nAn outside activity that is the same as or similar to your role or work at Apple could also be considered a  \\n\\nconflict of interest. Review the Business Conduct website for more information.\\n\\nWork with your manager and Business Conduct to evaluate a potential conflict of interest. If an outside activity \\n\\npresents a conflict of interest, you must partner with a People Business Partner, and obtain written approval \\n\\nfrom your manager, Legal (if applicable), and the senior most person reporting to the CEO of both your and any \\n\\nrelevant organizations. Contact Business Conduct to assist with Legal review.\\n\\nAny employee, full or part-time, who is participating in an outside activity, must comply with\\xa0the following rules. \\n\\nDo not:\\n\\n•  Use any time at work or any Apple assets for your outside activity. This includes Apple’s workspace, phones, \\n\\ncomputers, Internet access, photocopiers, and any other Apple assets or services.\\n\\n•  Use your position at Apple to solicit resources or any other benefit for your outside activity, obtain favored \\n\\ntreatment, or pressure others to assist you.\\n\\n•  Participate in an activity that could have an adverse effect on your ability to perform your duties at Apple.\\n\\n•  Use confidential Apple information.\\n\\nOutside Employment and Inventions\\n\\nBefore participating in creating inventions or businesses that are in the same area as your work for Apple, or that \\n\\ncompete with or relate to Apple’s present or reasonably anticipated business, products or services, you must \\n\\nhave written permission from your manager and the senior vice president of your organization. Before taking any \\n\\npaid employment outside of Apple, you should notify your manager.\\n\\nApp Creation \\n\\nYou can only create apps for personal or educational purposes. You cannot join the Developer Program or \\n\\nshare, sell, or distribute apps, stickers, or other media (for iOS, Android, or any other operating system), unless \\n\\nrequired for Apple business purposes. Some exceptions apply for employees who created apps before joining \\n\\nApple or who are joining Apple for a short period of time. If this applies to you, contact Business Conduct to \\n\\nunderstand what is permitted.\\n\\nBoard Positions\\n\\nYou may not serve as a director, trustee, officer, or advisory board member without prior approval from Apple. \\n\\nApple has pre-approved positions in certain organizations like residential boards (i.e., HOAs) and local sports \\n\\nand arts organizations, provided their activities do not conflict with Apple’s interests. Contact Business Conduct \\n\\nif you have any questions or if you would like to seek approval from Apple for a position that is not in a pre-\\n\\n 12\\n\\nBusiness ConductFebruary 2024 \\n\\x0cIntroduction\\n\\nBehaviors\\n\\nProtecting Apple\\n\\nAccountability\\n\\nIntegrity\\n\\nResources\\n\\napproved category. A board position that presents a potential or actual conflict of interest is unlikely to be \\n\\napproved.\\n\\nThe rule above relates to serving on a board in your individual capacity. If you have been asked to serve on a \\n\\nboard as a representative of Apple, you should work with your manager, Legal, and any impacted business \\n\\nteams to determine if Apple should participate, and whether you are the best person to represent Apple on that \\n\\nboard. If the position is on a public sector advisory board, work with Business Conduct to assess whether your \\n\\nparticipation would impact Apple’s ability to interact with that government agency. You should also consult with \\n\\nCorporate Communications, if applicable.\\n\\nPersonal Investments\\n\\nYou should avoid investing in companies that are Apple competitors or business partners when the investment \\n\\npresents a conflict of interest. When determining whether a personal investment creates a conflict of interest, \\n\\nconsider if you are in a position to influence transactions between Apple and a business in which you have \\n\\ninvested. If a real or apparent conflict arises, disclose the conflict to your manager. Your manager will help \\n\\ndetermine whether a conflict exists and, if appropriate, the best approach to eliminate the conflict. If you still \\n\\nneed help, contact Business Conduct.\\n\\nInsider Trading\\n\\nNever buy or sell Apple securities, including Apple stock, if you are aware of information that has not been publicly \\n\\nannounced and that could have a material effect on the value of the securities. It is illegal and against Apple policy \\n\\nto give anyone, including friends and family, tips on when to buy or sell securities when aware of material nonpublic \\n\\ninformation concerning that security. This applies to decisions to buy or sell Apple stock or the stock of an Apple supplier, \\n\\nmanufacturer, vendor, or customer, such as cellular network carriers or other channel partners.\\n\\nInformation is material if it would likely be considered important by an investor who is deciding whether to buy or sell a \\n\\nsecurity, or if the information is likely to have a significant effect on the market price of the security. Both positive and \\n\\nnegative information may be considered material. Examples of potential material information include financial results, \\n\\ninformation about new products or significant features, timing of significant product announcements or new product \\n\\nintroductions, news of a pending or proposed acquisition or other corporate transaction, significant changes in sources \\n\\nor availability of supplies, changes in dividend policy, significant product defects or modifications, and significant \\n\\ncybersecurity, or other data protection or privacy incidents. \\n\\nShort sales, transactions that hedge or offset, or are designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the value of Apple \\n\\nsecurities and transactions\\xa0in derivatives of Apple stock, are prohibited at all times, including transactions involving prepaid \\n\\nvariable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars, options, warrants, puts, calls, or similar instruments related to shares of \\n\\nApple stock.\\n\\nFor more information about restrictions on trading in securities as well as answers to FAQs, see the Insider Trading Policy or \\n\\nemail Insider Trading. \\n\\nCharitable Donations\\n\\nYou are encouraged to support charitable causes of your choosing as long as you do not use or furnish Apple assets \\n\\n(including your work time or use of Apple premises, equipment, or funds). Any charitable donations involving Apple \\n\\nassets are managed by the Corporate Donations team and must be approved by the VP of Environment, Policy, & Social \\n\\n 13\\n\\nBusiness ConductFebruary 2024\\x0cIntroduction\\n\\nBehaviors\\n\\nProtecting Apple\\n\\nAccountability\\n\\nIntegrity\\n\\nResources\\n\\nInitiatives. Any donation of 100K USD or more also requires the approval of the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial \\n\\nOfficer. For additional information, see the Finance Policy on charitable donations. This policy does not prevent you from \\n\\ntaking advantage of the Apple Matching Gifts Program to contribute to a nonprofit organization of your choice, or from \\n\\nparticipating in our Global Volunteer Program.  \\n\\nPolitical Contributions\\n\\nApple does not make political contributions to individual candidates or political parties. All corporate political contributions, \\n\\nwhether monetary or in-kind (including lending or donating equipment or technical services), must be approved in \\n\\nadvance by Apple’s CEO, and processed by Government Affairs and Political Compliance to ensure compliance with \\n\\nlegal requirements and Apple policy. You may not use Apple resources, including employee work time, Apple premises, \\n\\nequipment, or funds, to personally support candidates and campaigns. It is also illegal for Apple to reimburse an employee \\n\\nfor a political contribution. For more information, see the Corporate Political Compliance Policy and the Apple Public Policy \\n\\nAdvocacy website.\\n\\nPersonal Political Activities\\n\\nYou are free to personally participate in political activities, including running for and serving in public positions, and \\n\\nsupporting candidates and causes, as long as you comply with the points below: \\n\\n•   Do not represent or give the impression that you are representing Apple during any political activities or in campaign \\n\\nmaterials.\\n\\n•   Do not make public comments that could be misconstrued as being made on behalf of Apple, or give the impression that \\n\\nApple is endorsing any particular legislation, position, or issue.\\n\\n•   Do not use Apple work time, equipment, or resources for political or campaign activities.\\n\\n•   If holding a public office, you may need to recuse yourself from any matters involving Apple.\\n\\nGifts\\n\\nGiving or accepting gifts can create a real or perceived conflict of interest and can lead to a perception of favoritism or an \\n\\nexpectation of reciprocity that could compromise an employee’s objectivity. This policy applies to giving or accepting gifts \\n\\nto or from current or potential vendors, suppliers, customers, or other business associates with whom you have a current or \\n\\npotential business relationship. Gifts between employees don’t fall under this policy.\\n\\nA gift is considered anything of value, including a meal, travel, entertainment (including tickets), Apple logo items, \\n\\nequipment (including loans), or discounts. Gifts must be legal, and gifts given with the purpose of influencing a decision \\n\\nare always prohibited. Gifts that are cash or cash equivalents, such as gift cards, are never allowed. Paying for a gift without \\n\\ngetting reimbursement from Apple does not remove the requirement to comply with the gift policy.\\n\\nApple employees are under either a zero gift rule or a $150 gift rule, depending on their organization. Refer to the Gifts \\n\\npage on the Business Conduct website to determine the rule that applies to you. Employees under a zero gift rule may not \\n\\ngive or accept gifts of any value unless one of the key exceptions below applies. Employees under the $150 gift rule may \\n\\nonly give or accept gifts if the value is $150 or less, unless one of the key exceptions below applies. \\n\\nKey Exceptions\\n\\nGifts that fall under one of the following exceptions are permissible for most employees, regardless of gift rule (additional \\n\\n 14\\n\\nBusiness ConductFebruary 2024\\x0cIntroduction\\n\\nBehaviors\\n\\nProtecting Apple\\n\\nAccountability\\n\\nIntegrity\\n\\nResources\\n\\napproval requirements may be noted):\\n\\n•   Business meals. With the exception of Apple Store employees, employees may provide and accept reasonable and \\n\\nappropriate business-related meals, provided they are limited in frequency and expense. Any meals paid for by Apple \\n\\nmust comply with Apple’s Travel and Expense Reimbursement Finance Policy. Employees in Operations must obtain \\n\\napproval from their manager to accept business meals. Approval should occur beforehand when possible.\\n\\n•  Low-value items. With the exception of Operations and Apple Store employees, employees may accept low-value and \\n\\ninfrequent promotional items or other nominal tokens of appreciation.\\n\\n•   Business-related event attendance. With the exception of Operations and Apple Store employees, free tickets for \\n\\nsporting events and other forms of entertainment where participation is directly related to an employee’s job function \\n\\nand part of legitimate Apple business are not considered a gift under Apple’s policy. If you are unsure if attendance \\n\\nat an event is directly related to your role, check with your manager. For high-value or high-profile events, you should \\n\\nreview your attendance with your manager and your vice president. Employees should never use relationships built \\n\\nthrough Apple business for their personal advantage, such as obtaining tickets that are difficult to access, since that is \\n\\npreferential treatment and could be considered a conflict of interest.\\n\\n•   Conferences. With the exception of Operations and Apple Store employees, free tickets to conferences that are offered \\n\\nby a vendor, supplier or other third party are permissible if the tickets are free to all attendees, offered as part of a \\n\\ncontract with Apple, or offered to all customers of a particular vendor. Tickets outside of those parameters do not fall \\n\\nunder an exception, and require approval if the value is over your gift limit. Conference tickets purchased by Apple are \\n\\nnot a gift.\\n\\n•   Vendor-supplied local ground transportation. Operations employees may accept reasonable local ground \\n\\ntransportation provided by vendors to and from work locations.\\n\\nAny other exceptions must be approved by your vice president. For vice president–level employees, exceptions must be \\n\\napproved by your manager.\\n\\nRefusing and Returning Gifts \\n\\nGifts outside the limits of your gift rule should be declined or returned whenever possible. If it is impossible or inappropriate \\n\\nto refuse or return a gift, you should notify your manager and People Business Partner immediately after accepting the gift, \\n\\nthen contact Business Conduct for further guidance. Perishable, non-alcohol gifts may be placed in a common area for \\n\\nemployees to share. For more information, see the Business Conduct website. \\n\\nSamples \\n\\nCurrent and potential vendors and suppliers may provide product samples to Apple for business evaluation purposes. \\n\\nThese samples are not gifts and may not be used for personal purposes. Receipt of samples should be documented \\n\\naccording to any internal division policies, and where appropriate, returned to the vendor and supplier when the evaluation \\n\\nis complete.\\n\\n 15\\n\\nBusiness ConductFebruary 2024\\x0cIntroduction\\n\\nBehaviors\\n\\nProtecting Apple\\n\\nAccountability\\n\\nIntegrity\\n\\nResources\\n\\nGifts to Public Officials\\n\\nApple permits providing gifts to public officials only when permissible under applicable laws and policies. A public official \\n\\nis any person who is paid with government funds or performs a public function. This includes individuals who are elected \\n\\nor appointed to public office, as well as individuals who work for local, state/provincial or national government, public \\n\\ninternational organizations, public (government-owned or operated) schools, and state-owned or state-run enterprises. \\n\\nEmployees at such organizations are considered public officials regardless of title or position. \\n\\nU.S. Public Officials \\n\\nFor U.S. public officials, anything other than refreshments of nominal value ($10 or less) must be pre-approved by Political \\n\\nCompliance or comply with internal guidelines if available, including disclosure requirements\\n\\nNon-U.S. Public Officials\\n\\nIn many countries, it is considered customary to provide token ceremonial gifts to government officials on certain \\n\\noccasions. All gifts exceeding USD $10 in value require pre-approval from Political Compliance or your regional Apple legal \\n\\ncounsel. Meals that comply with posted guidance or a country are permissible and do not need pre-approval. Meals that \\n\\nare frequent and/or lavish could appear to influence a business decision and are inappropriate. \\n\\n 16\\n\\nBusiness ConductFebruary 2024\\x0cIntroduction\\n\\nBehaviors\\n\\nProtecting Apple\\n\\nAccountability\\n\\nIntegrity\\n\\nResources\\n\\nBusiness Integrity \\n\\nGovernments as Customers\\n\\nGovernments are unique customers for Apple. They often have unique bidding, pricing, disclosure, and certification \\n\\nrequirements. When dealing with government customers, make sure to partner with Legal when bidding for business, and \\n\\ncontact Business Conduct with questions relating to compliance requirements. \\n\\nHiring Government Employees\\n\\nLaws often limit the duties and types of services that former government, military, or other public sector employees \\n\\nmay perform as employees or consultants of Apple, especially in regard to matters they were involved in while with the \\n\\ngovernment.\\xa0Employment negotiations with government employees may be subject to legal restrictions and disclosure \\n\\nrequirements, particularly if the government employee is involved in a matter involving Apple’s interests.\\xa0Contact Political \\n\\nCompliance before entering such negotiations. You may never hire any individual in exchange for securing or retaining \\n\\nbusiness, or securing an improper advantage. We also prohibit hiring preference being given to anyone in return for special \\n\\ntreatment of any kind. For more information, see the Anti-Corruption Recruiting Policy.\\n\\nBribery and Corruption\\n\\nAt Apple, we do not tolerate corruption in connection with any of our business dealings. Corruption can take many forms, \\n\\nbut most often it occurs through bribery. A bribe is offering or giving anything of value, including cash, cash equivalents \\n\\nsuch as gift cards, gifts, meals, travel and entertainment, to any person for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, \\n\\nor securing an improper advantage. You cannot offer or receive bribes from any individual, regardless of whether that \\n\\nindividual is a public official or a private party. Kickbacks are a type of bribery, and occur when a person is offered money \\n\\nor something of value in exchange for providing something, such as information, a discount or a favor, to a third party. \\n\\nKickbacks are not permissible and are strictly prohibited by Apple.\\n\\nFacilitating payments are a type of bribe generally used to facilitate or expedite the performance of routine, non-\\n\\ndiscretionary government action. These payments are not permissible and are strictly prohibited by Apple. Exceptions may \\n\\nbe made in circumstances that involve an imminent threat to health or safety, and such situations must be immediately \\n\\nreported to Business Conduct.\\n\\nApple can be found responsible for bribes, kickbacks, and/or facilitating payments made by third parties in connection with \\n\\nApple’s business. Before engaging a third party that will be interacting with the government or public officials on Apple’s \\n\\nbehalf, contact Business Conduct to evaluate whether we need to conduct additional due diligence.\\n\\nFor more information, see the Anti-Corruption Policy and other resources available on the Business Conduct and Global \\n\\nCompliance website.\\n\\n 17\\n\\nBusiness ConductFebruary 2024\\x0cIntroduction\\n\\nBehaviors\\n\\nProtecting Apple\\n\\nAccountability\\n\\nIntegrity\\n\\nResources\\n\\nMoney Laundering\\n\\nMoney laundering occurs when individuals or organizations try to conceal illicit funds or make those funds look legitimate. \\n\\nMoney laundering is illegal and strictly prohibited by Apple. In certain countries, we are required to report suspicious \\n\\nactivity. If you deal directly with customers or vendors, the following examples may signal potential money laundering:\\n\\n•   Attempts to make large payments in cash\\n\\n•   Payments by someone who is not a party to the contract\\n\\n•   Requests to pay more than provided for in the contract\\n\\n•   Payments made in currencies other than those specified in the contract\\n\\n•   Payments from an unusual, nonbusiness account\\n\\n•   Transactions forming an unusual pattern such as bulk purchases of products or gift cards or repetitive cash payments\\n\\nCompetition and Trade Practices\\n\\nCompetition and innovation are at the core of Apple’s DNA. We vigorously compete to develop and create the very best \\n\\nproducts for our customers. Apple will never seek to eliminate or reduce competition through illegal agreements with \\n\\ncompetitors. Agreements with competitors are subject to rigorous scrutiny in all countries. Agreements with our resellers, \\n\\ndistributors, and suppliers can also give rise to scrutiny, particularly if Apple has a leading position in the market.\\n\\nYou should never:\\n\\n•    Agree with or exchange information with competitors regarding price, policies, contract terms, costs, inventories, \\n\\nmarketing plans, capacity plans, or other competitively significant data.\\n\\n•   Agree with competitors to divide or assign sales territories, products, or dedicate customers.\\n\\n•   Agree with resellers on the resale pricing of Apple products without legal approval. Resellers are free to determine their \\n\\nown resale pricing.\\n\\n•   Violate fair bidding practices, including bidding quiet periods, or provide information to benefit one vendor over other \\n\\nvendors.\\n\\n•  Remember: Always consult the\\xa0Competition Law Team\\xa0whenever you have a question. For more information, see \\n\\nthe\\xa0Antitrust and Competition Law Policy.\\n\\nObtaining and Using Business Intelligence\\n\\nGathering information about customers, competitors, and markets in which we operate is a common business practice, but \\n\\nyou must always do so with integrity. You may generally obtain information from public sources, surveys, and competitive \\n\\nresearch. Personal information shall not be obtained from third parties without confirming with Privacy. We do not seek \\n\\nbusiness intelligence by illegal or unethical means. It is never appropriate to engage in theft, espionage, or breach of a \\n\\nnon-disclosure agreement. If you obtain confidential nonpublic information, accidentally or provided by unknown sources, \\n\\nthat relates to a competitor, it may be unethical to use the information. If this happens to you, immediately contact your \\n\\nmanager, Legal, or Business Conduct. \\n\\nTrade Restrictions and Import/Export Controls \\n\\nMany countries periodically impose restrictions on imports, exports, and other dealings with certain countries, persons, \\n\\nor groups. These can include the trading of commodities or technologies, travel to or from a sanctioned country, and \\n\\ninvestments. Certain laws also prohibit support of boycott activities. If your work involves the sale or shipment of products, \\n\\ntechnologies, or services across international borders, always consult Global Export and Sanctions Compliance before \\n\\nmoving goods.

       " 'Apple Anti-Corruption Policy  \\n\\nCorruption can take many forms, but most often it occurs through \\nbribery. At Apple, we do not tolerate any form of corruption in connection \\nwith our business dealings. If you are unsure of the proper course of \\naction, or whether something constitutes corruption, contact Business \\nConduct.  \\n\\nBribery  \\n\\nA bribe is offering or giving anything of value to any person for the \\npurpose of obtaining or retaining business, or securing an improper \\nadvantage.  \\n\\nYou cannot offer or receive bribes from any individual, regardless of \\nwhether that individual is a public official or a private party. \\n\\nAnything of value includes cash, cash equivalents such as gift cards, \\ngifts, meals, travel and entertainment, and can also include a promise, or \\nguarantee of something of value. Anything of value can also include job \\noffers. Apple does not offer employment of any kind, including \\ninternships and contract positions, in order to obtain or retain business or \\ngain a business advantage. Please refer to the Anti-Corruption Recruiting \\nPolicy for additional information.  \\n\\nReasonable and customary business gifts, meals, and hospitality \\nprovided for a legitimate business purpose may be permissible under \\ninternational and local anti-corruption laws, but must be provided in \\naccordance with Apple policy. Please refer to Apple’s Business Conduct \\nPolicy for additional information.  \\n\\nKickbacks are a type of bribery, and occur when a person is offered \\nmoney or something of value in exchange for providing something to a \\nthird party. The third party may be requesting information, a discount, or a \\nfavor. Like all other bribes, kickbacks may be in the form of cash or the \\nequivalent, gifts, meals, and entertainment.  Kickbacks are not \\npermissible and are strictly prohibited by Apple. \\n\\nJune 2018\\n\\n 1\\n\\n\\x0cFacilitating payments are a type of bribe generally used to facilitate or \\nexpedite the performance of routine, non-discretionary government \\naction. These types of payments are typically demanded by low-level \\nofficials in exchange for providing a service that is ordinarily and \\ncommonly performed by the official. These payments are not permissible \\nand are strictly prohibited by Apple. Exceptions may be made in \\ncircumstances that involve an imminent threat to health or safety and \\nsuch situations must be immediately reported to Business Conduct.  \\n\\nA published, well-documented expediting fee paid directly to a \\ngovernment or state-owned agency is not typically considered a \\nfacilitating payment under anti-corruption laws. For example, paying a \\nfee to expedite a passport application, deliver a package, or process \\ngovernment paperwork such as visas, is not considered a facilitating \\npayment for purposes of corruption laws, if those fees are payable to a \\nentity - not an individual - and are published openly. If you have a \\nquestion as to whether a payment is permissible, contact Business \\nConduct. \\n\\nPublic Officials  \\n\\nA “public official” is any person who is paid with government funds or serves in \\na public function.  This includes individuals who work for a local, state/provincial \\nor national government, or a public international organization, as well as \\nemployees of public (government-owned or operated) schools, hospitals, and \\nstate-owned enterprises. Employees at such organizations are considered \\npublic officials regardless of title or position. In some instances, it may be \\ndifficult to determine if an individual is a public official, especially if you are \\ninteracting with them in a non-governmental capacity. If you are unsure, contact \\nBusiness Conduct for guidance. \\n\\nIn many instances, there are specific guidelines regarding gifts, meals, travel, \\nand entertainment provided to public officials. These guidelines generally also \\napply to immediate family members of a public official. Gifts and meals provided \\nto U.S. public officials must comply with the Ethics Policy Events Involving \\nGovernment or Public Employees or Officials. Meals provided to non-U.S. public \\nemployees and officials must comply with the posted country-by-country chart \\nof Permissible Limits for Business Meals Provided to Non U.S. Public Officials. \\n\\nIf permitted under local law, Apple can pay reasonable travel expenses for public \\nemployees or officials that are directly related to the promotion, demonstration, \\nor explanation of products and services. However, all such travel expenses must \\nbe pre-approved by Business Conduct or Legal. If you are hosting an event \\nwhere public employees or officials are invited, you must follow the Ethics Policy \\nfor Events Involving Government or Public Employees or Officials. \\n\\nJune 2018\\n\\n 2\\n\\n\\x0cThird Parties  \\n\\nApple can be found responsible for bribes, kickbacks, and/or facilitating payments \\nmade by third parties in connection with Apple’s business. Third parties also have \\nan obligation to ensure that their third parties, such as sub-contractors or agents, \\nunderstand and comply with this Policy and applicable anti-corruption laws. Third \\nparties may not be used to circumvent the laws or this Policy. Willful ignorance is \\nnot a defense.  \\n\\nBefore engaging a third party that will be interacting with the government or \\npublic officials on Apple’s behalf, contact globalcompliance@apple.com to \\nevaluate whether we need to conduct additional due diligence. Please refer to the \\nDue Diligence Policy for additional information.  \\n\\nBe on the lookout for these red flags when dealing with third parties and \\nsubcontractors and alert Business Conduct if you become aware of any of the \\nfollowing:  \\n\\n•  Rumors of, or a reputation for, bribery;  \\n\\n•  Minimal detail on invoices or expense claims involving interactions with \\npublic officials or government agencies, including lump sum requests, \\nrequests for large commissions or payments, or payments made through \\na third party or another country; \\n\\n•  A close relationship with a public official or ministry, or insistence on \\n\\nusing a specific consultant or one who provides little to no obvious added \\nvalue. \\n\\nAccurate Records and Internal Controls \\n\\nApple is legally required to make and keep accurate records that truthfully and \\naccurately reflect all the transactions of the corporation and maintain an \\nadequate system of internal accounting controls. This includes preserving \\nsupporting documentation and proper approvals.  \\n\\nEnsure that all relevant records — including invoices, expense reports, and any \\nother business record — accurately reflect the transaction. Do not misstate \\nfacts, omit information or modify records or reports in any way. Provide as much \\ndetail as possible. When interacting with public officials or government \\nagencies, ensure that you’re providing a thorough description of the services \\nbeing rendered, including detail of services provided and/or tasks performed, \\ngovernment interactions, and detailed cost breakdown. Simply providing a \\nlimited description like “construction and project management”, “product \\ncertification” or “design fee” is not acceptable.  \\n\\nJune 2018\\n\\n 3\\n\\n\\x0cIf you are confronted with a demand to pay a bribe or are offered a kickback, you \\nmust refuse. Explain that these types of payments are illegal and are against \\nApple policy, and report the incident to Business Conduct.  \\n\\nReporting Potential or Actual Violations \\n\\nYou should consult with Business Conduct if there is a question as to the \\nappropriateness of a particular business decision or course of action. Monitor \\nthird parties closely, especially if they interact with public officials on Apple’s \\nbehalf or benefit. Any employee who learns of any misconduct or suspicious \\nactivities, including potential violations of this Policy and the law, must \\nimmediately report such misconduct either to Business Conduct or Legal. \\n\\nQuestions  \\n\\nAll questions about information contained in this Policy should be directed to \\nBusiness Conduct. \\n\\nRetaliation Is Not Tolerated \\n\\nApple will not retaliate – and will not tolerate retaliation – against any individual \\nfor filing a good-faith complaint with management, HR, Legal, Internal Audit, \\nFinance, or Business Conduct, or for participating in the investigation of any \\nsuch complaint. \\n\\nJune 2018\\n\\n 4\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",

       " 'Apple Global Whistleblowing Policy \\n\\nApple conducts business ethically, honestly, and in compliance with applicable laws and \\nregulations. This applies to every business decision in every area of the company worldwide. \\nApple is committed to ensuring that the company fosters a culture where our people and \\nstakeholders are encouraged to report concerns without fear of retaliation.  \\n\\nThis Global Whistleblowing Policy applies to all current and former employees, directors and \\nofficers, contractors and subcontractors of Apple and its subsidiaries, and sets out Apple’s \\napproach to protecting and supporting individuals who report potential misconduct.  \\n\\nThe Audit and Finance Committee of Apple’s Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing \\nmanagement’s implementation of this policy and associated procedures. Apple’s Business \\nConduct organization has overall operational responsibility for this policy. In addition, the Audit \\nand Finance Committee of Apple’s Board of Directors has established procedures to govern the \\nretention and treatment of complaints regarding Apple’s accounting or auditing matters. \\n\\nThis Policy does not constitute a contract of employment, and Apple reserves the right to update \\nthis policy from time to time.  \\n\\nSpeak Up \\n\\nIf you have knowledge of, or a reasonable good-faith ground to suspect, wrongdoing related to \\nApple — whether it be a breach of internal policies, principles, or legal or regulatory obligations — \\nwe encourage you to speak up.\\xa0 You should feel comfortable about voicing your concerns so that \\nApple can investigate.\\xa0  \\n\\nIf you are an employee of Apple or its subsidiaries, you are expected to notify either your manager, \\nPeople, Legal or Business Conduct if you become aware of any violation of the Business Conduct \\nPolicy, other Apple policies, or legal or regulatory requirements. \\n\\nReporting of certain types of actual or suspected wrongdoing that are in the public interest and \\naffect others is often described as whistleblowing. Depending on applicable law, whistleblowing \\nreports may include, but are not limited to, suspicions of wrongdoing regarding: \\n\\n• Financial malpractice, misrepresentations, impropriety, or fraud, including accounting and \\n\\nauditing or disclosure concerns \\n\\n• Failure to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation \\n\\n• Public health and product safety \\n\\n• Risk or damage to the environment \\n\\n• Criminal activity \\n\\n• Bribery, facilitation of tax evasion or money laundering \\n\\n• Privacy and data protection breaches \\n\\n• Anti-competitive conduct \\n\\n• Breaches of sanctions \\n\\n• Violations of human rights, such as modern slavery and human trafficking  \\n\\n• Attempts to cover up any of these behaviors\\n\\n\\x0cReporting Concerns \\n\\nIf you are an Apple employee, you can contact Apple’s Business Conduct team by phone, email, or \\nthrough the Business Conduct website. You can also report concerns to your manager, the People \\nteam, or Legal. If you believe you have been harassed or discriminated against, or have witnessed \\nsuch behavior, visit the People team’s internal Reporting a Concern page.  \\n\\nApple’s external helpline (apple.ethicspoint.com) is available for both internal and external parties \\nto report concerns, and provides the option of anonymous reporting, where permissible under \\napplicable laws. The external helpline is available at any time, and provides online reporting as well \\nas local, toll-free phone numbers that connect reporters to a multilingual reporting service.  \\n\\nConcerns regarding accounting or auditing matters can be directed to the Audit and Finance \\nCommittee through the above internal and external channels. \\n\\nWhen making your report, we encourage you to provide as much detail as possible concerning the \\nsuspected wrongdoing. This will allow us to conduct any investigation promptly and effectively. \\n\\nReporting Wrongdoing Outside of Apple \\n\\nMany laws and regulators require or encourage current and former employees to first report their \\nconcerns internally, and we encourage any individual to report their concerns directly to Apple. \\nThis allows Apple to use all its investigate resources to look into the concern. However, Apple \\nrecognizes the rights of its employees to raise concerns externally, including making disclosures \\nto prescribed persons or bodies under local laws, such as local regulators, in certain cases. You \\nare also permitted to speak freely about your wages, hours, and working conditions, including \\ninformation about harassment, discrimination, or any other conduct you have reason to believe is \\nunlawful, and nothing in this Policy, or any Apple policy, should be interpreted as being restrictive \\nof your right to do so.  \\n\\nExternal reporting may be appropriate if there is immediate and significant danger to the public \\ninterest, reasonable suspicion that the company at large is involved in the suspected wrongdoing, \\nor a clear risk of evidence being falsified or destroyed. Nothing in this policy will prevent you from \\ncommunicating your concern, as covered by this policy, to a regulator or certain third parties, \\nprovided any such communications comply with applicable legal requirements.  \\n\\nIf external reporting is appropriate, we strongly encourage you to seek local advice before \\nreporting a concern externally. In many jurisdictions there are designated bodies to which such \\nreports must be made.  \\n\\nConfidentiality \\n\\nApple will treat all disclosures of suspected wrongdoing in a confidential and sensitive manner and \\nmaintain your privacy. Confidential means that your identity will be shared only with those who \\nhave a need to know in order to effectively conduct any investigation and follow up action \\n(including, if necessary, disciplinary action) on your concern, or where there is a legal requirement \\nto share your identity. \\n\\nYou should only disclose information that is relevant to the concern and avoid providing \\ninformation not relevant to the concern. Any personal information that you disclose while reporting \\n\\nApple Global Whistleblowing Policy\\n\\n2\\n\\nJanuary 2023 \\n\\n\\x0ca concern will be managed as outlined in the Whistleblowing Personal Information Guidelines. If \\nyou have further questions on the treatment of your personal data, you should contact us as \\ndetailed on the Privacy Enquiries site. \\n\\nIf you make an anonymous report, keep in mind that it may be more difficult to investigate an \\nanonymous concern due to difficulty in obtaining specific details and/or answers to follow up \\nquestions. Some local laws also discourage anonymous reporting, including in most European \\ncountries, where anonymous allegations are discouraged and should be limited to accounting and \\ninternal controls issues, including fraud, inaccurate records, auditing, bribery and corruption, and \\nother financial matters. \\n\\nRegardless of how a report is made, we encourage you to share all the information you have \\nconcerning the suspected wrongdoing. Providing sufficient details will help Apple in conducting a \\nthorough and effective investigation.  \\n\\nNo Retaliation  \\n\\nApple will not retaliate — and will not tolerate any retaliation — against any individual for raising a \\ngood-faith and genuine concern within Apple or to the appropriate body under local law, or for \\nparticipating in the investigation of any complaint. \\n\\nAny person who retaliates against a whistleblower, threatens any such retaliation, or is involved in \\nany such conduct may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of \\nemployment or contractual relationship with Apple. \\n\\nRegional Laws and Agencies \\n\\nSome states/provinces and countries have specific laws associated with whistleblowing. \\nEmployees who would like more information on any applicable local legal requirements and \\nresources should visit the People site.\\n\\nApple Global Whistleblowing Policy\\n\\n3\\n\\nJanuary 2023 \\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
       " \"Third Party Code of Conduct  \\n\\nOur Principles  \\n\\nAt Apple, we believe in doing business ethically, transparently, and in full \\ncompliance with all applicable laws and regulations.  Apple requires all \\nbusinesses and persons that associate themselves with our brand to uphold \\nthese same high standards. To that end, Apple requires certain third parties \\nworking with Apple or on behalf of Apple worldwide to comply with this Third \\nParty Code of Conduct (Code). \\n\\nWho  \\n\\nThis Code applies to certain third parties that work with or on behalf of Apple. \\nThis includes, but is not limited to, channel members (distributors, resellers, \\nservice providers, and carriers) and any other third party not covered by \\nApple’s Supplier Code of Conduct (collectively, “third parties”). Your \\nemployees, independent and sub-contractors, consultants, or anyone that you \\nwork with or contract with as part of your relationship with Apple should \\nunderstand and comply with all provisions of this Code.  \\n\\nOur Expectations  \\n\\nThird parties must be committed to high standards of ethical conduct in all \\nbusiness dealings and must comply with all applicable legal requirements. Third \\nparties must demonstrate integrity in every business interaction and avoid \\nengaging in any activity that involves the appearance of impropriety. \\n\\nYour Responsibilities  \\n\\nWhere applicable or required by law, third parties must establish policies, \\nprocedures, and monitoring practices so their employees, independent \\ncontractors, consultants, and all others who do business for or on their behalf \\n(in relation to Apple’s business) understand and comply with all provisions of \\nthis Code and other applicable Apple policies. This includes conducting due \\ndiligence on its own third parties who are performing work in relation to Apple’s \\nbusiness.  \\n\\nThird parties must treat customers, business partners, employees, and others \\nwith respect and courtesy.  Third parties should have a process in place to \\nensure complaints, questions, and allegations can be reported in a safe, \\nconfidential, and anonymous (where allowed by law) manner.

We expect our third parties to ensure the workplace is fair \\nand ethical and that all workers are treated with the utmost respect and dignity.  \\n\\nHuman Rights. Third parties must uphold internationally recognized human \\nrights and treat workers with dignity and respect. Please refer to Apple’s Human \\nRights Policy for detailed information and additional expectations. \\n\\nAnti-Discrimination. Third parties may not discriminate against any worker \\nbased on race, color, age, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, disability, \\npregnancy, religion, political affiliation, union membership, national origin, or \\nmarital status in hiring and employment practices such as applications for \\nemployment, promotions, rewards, access to training, job assignments, wages, \\nbenefits, discipline, termination, and retirement. In addition, third parties may not \\nrequire workers or potential workers to undergo medical tests that could be used \\nin a discriminatory way, except where required by applicable law or regulation or \\nprudent for workplace safety. \\n\\nAnti-Harassment and Abuse. Third parties must be committed to a workplace \\nfree of harassment. Third parties may not threaten or subject workers to harsh or \\ninhumane treatment, including sexual harassment, sexual abuse, corporal \\npunishment, mental coercion, physical coercion, or verbal abuse. \\n\\nPrevention of Involuntary Labor and Human Trafficking. Third parties must \\nensure that all work is voluntary. Third parties may not traffic persons or use any \\nform of slave, forced, bonded, indentured, or prison labor.

But it doesn’t end there. \\n\\nWe believe in the power of technology to empower and connect people around the world—\\nand that business can and should be a force for good. Achieving that takes innovation, hard \\nwork, and a focus on serving others. \\n\\nIt also means leading with our values. Our human rights policy governs how we treat \\neveryone—from our customers and teams to our business partners and people at every \\nlevel of our supply chain.  \\n\\nWith humility, optimism, and an abiding faith in people, we’re committed to respecting the \\nhuman rights of everyone whose lives we touch. \\n\\nOur Commitment to Human Rights \\n\\nWe’re deeply committed to continually assessing our progress and building the lessons  \\nwe learn into everything we do.

Across all our services, including the App Store, Apple Podcasts, and others, users \\ncan choose from a wide variety of options, and we carefully review the content on every \\nApple app and service against our guidelines and standards. \\n\\nWe work every day to make quality products, including content and services, available  \\nto our users in a way that respects their human rights.

We do that through \\nmandatory trainings on labor and human rights, regular and independent audits, and an \\nanonymous reporting system in which we investigate every complaint. If a company is  \\nnot willing or able to meet our high standards, we will no longer do business with them. \\n\\nWe want to be a force for good in the lives of people in our supply chain and their \\ncommunities.

While Apple considers compliance with this Standard to be \\nthe minimum a Supplier must do to remain in Apple’s supply chain, a Supplier \\nshould seek to go beyond the minimum and apply any relevant best practices \\nwherever possible. Apple anticipates that in the future, only Suppliers \\nexceeding minimum requirements and operating at the best practices level \\nare likely to remain in Apple’s supply chain. \\n\\nSupplier Code of Conduct Requirements \\n\\n• Suppliers shall exercise due diligence on Relevant Minerals and Relevant \\n\\nMaterials in their Supply Chain. \\n\\n• Suppliers shall develop particular due diligence policies and \\n\\nmanagement systems in order to identify applicable risks and take \\nappropriate steps to mitigate them. \\n\\n• Due diligence shall be conducted to the material processing level in order \\n\\nto determine whether relevant materials originate from High Risk \\nRegions, including areas associated with conflict, the worst forms of child \\nlabor, forced labor and human trafficking, gross human rights violations \\nsuch as widespread sexual violence, or other reasonably objective high \\nrisk activities, including severe health and safety risks and negative \\nenvironmental impacts. \\n\\nSupplier Responsibility Standards \\n\\n1. Due Diligence System, Policy, and Use of Relevant \\nMinerals and Relevant Materials \\n\\n1.1 Supplier Due Diligence Management System  \\nSuppliers shall develop an appropriate management system to conduct due \\ndiligence in accordance with the standards set out in the OECD Due Diligence \\nGuidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected \\nand High-Risk Areas (the “OECD Guidance”) and other applicable \\ninternational standards, as described in this Standard (see Section 6 of this \\nStandard). For Suppliers using Relevant Materials, see also the OECD-FAO \\nGuidance for Responsible Agricultural Supply Chains (the “OECD-FAO \\nGuidance”).  \\n\\n• A due diligence management system shall include: \\n• Risk identification \\n• Risk prevention and mitigation \\n\\nResponsible Sourcing of Materials \\nVersion: 4.8   Effective date: January 1, 2022\\n\\nDefinitions \\n\\nSupply Chain \\n\\nThe path of a supply from a point \\nof origin, such as a mine for mined \\nmaterials, a farm for biologically \\ngrown materials, or a point of \\ncollection for recycled materials, to \\nApple, which for a Supplier may \\ninclude owned, operated, direct \\nand/or indirect sourcing through a \\nSubcontractor, Supplier, Processor, \\nMining Company or other source \\nfrom which a Relevant Material \\nmay be mined, biologically grown, \\nprocessed, traded, recycled, \\ncompounded, refined, or \\nmanufactured into Goods used by \\nthe Supplier in Apple products.  \\n\\nProcessors \\n\\nAny entity that smelts or refines \\nRelevant Materials or the point at \\nwhich the Relevant Materials are \\nfirst processed. For minerals, this \\nwould constitute processing from \\nore into refined metal or the re-\\nprocessing of scrap or other waste \\ninto recycled or re-used content \\n(typically a smelter, refiner, or \\nrecycler). For other materials, such \\nas Bio-materials, this would \\nconstitute processing from farmed \\ncommodity into a refined or \\nisolated byproduct (such as a mill \\nor tannery), a precursor or a \\ncompound.  \\nAdditionally, if the Processor \\nsources materials from a trader or \\nexchange, the Processor should \\nensure that those intermediaries \\nhave policies to the primary \\nproduction level, the original \\nsource of primary ore at the mining \\nlevel, or the agricultural commodity \\nat the farm level. \\n\\nProcessor and/or Trader \\n\\nIncludes those who process or \\nrecycle Relevant Materials, \\nrecycled materials, or perform \\naggregation of relevant materials.\\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0c• Third Party verifications or audits of Supply Chain due diligence \\n• A mechanism for reporting applicable risks. \\n\\n1.2 Supplier Policy Requirements \\nSuppliers shall have a due diligence policy that is consistent with OECD \\nGuidance and/or the OECD-FAO Guidance (as applicable), and this Standard. \\nThe policy shall also require Processors in the Supplier’s Supply Chain to have \\ncorresponding due diligence policies down to the level of the Source or Origin, \\nwhich includes the level of Mining Companies, farms, collection points of \\nRecyclable Waste, or the original source of primary ore at the mining level.  \\n\\nSuppliers shall ensure that their facilities and suppliers comply with the \\nobligations and requirements of this Standard. \\n\\n1.3 Supplier Policy Distribution \\nFor Relevant Minerals, Suppliers shall distribute their policies to: \\n\\n• All subcontractors and suppliers that produce Goods for use in Apple’s \\n\\nproducts \\n\\n• Supplier procurement personnel and factory management. \\n\\nFor Relevant Materials, Suppliers shall distribute their policies to Apple. As \\nappropriate, Apple may require a Supplier to distribute their policies further.  \\n\\n1.4 Use of Relevant Minerals and Relevant Materials  \\nSuppliers shall not use Relevant Minerals or Relevant Materials in any Goods \\nproduced for use in Apple’s products if a Supplier cannot reasonably \\ndemonstrate that it has a due diligence management system and has \\nperformed the required due diligence activities, as outlined below.  \\n\\nTo the extent that a Supplier seeks only to implement a due diligence \\nmanagement system and perform required due diligence activities with \\nrespect to specific Apple-related supply lines, Apple may require, as \\nappropriate, such Supplier to (i) demonstrate to Apple a reasonably \\ncomprehensive system to segregate Relevant Minerals or Relevant Materials \\nfor use in Apple’s products from Relevant Materials or Relevant Materials used \\nin other parties’ products and (ii) undergo a Third Party verification or audit of \\nsuch a segregation system. \\n\\nIn addition to the requirements pertaining to Relevant Materials, the following \\nuse restrictions apply to the use of leather in Goods: \\n\\n• Only domesticated bovines (limited to cow, steer, bull, calf, or oxen) \\n\\nraised for food production may be used. Leather originating from wild \\nbovines (including but not limited to bison, water or cape buffalo), exotic \\nspecies (including but not limited to shark, crocodile, or snake), or \\nbovines raised only for their skin or hide (i.e., non-food sourced) are not \\npermitted. \\n\\n• No Endangered or Threatened Species (defined as species listed on \\nthe red list by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and \\nNatural Resources) shall be used. \\n\\n• No leathers from animals raised or slaughtered in Bangladesh, Brazil, \\n\\nChina, India or Morocco shall be used. \\n\\n• Animals in the production of leather, including at the farm, in transport, or \\nat any other point in the Supply Chain shall not be treated inhumanely. \\n\\nResponsible Sourcing of Materials \\nVersion: 4.8   Effective date: January 1, 2022\\n\\n118\\n\\nDefinitions \\n\\nMining Companies \\n\\nAny entity that mines or manages \\nmining operations of Relevant \\nMinerals and produces primary \\nore.

Risk Identification \\n\\nSuppliers shall identify the High Risks in their Supply Chains by first \\nunderstanding the Processors of Relevant Minerals or Relevant Materials in \\ntheir Supply Chains. For Relevant Materials, High Risks shall be identified back \\nto the Source or Origin level. As new Relevant Minerals or Relevant Materials \\nare included in this Standard, Apple will provide timelines for a phase-in \\nperiod in order for Suppliers to implement corresponding risk identification \\nrequirements. Types of High Risks are: \\n\\n• Red Flag Risks — at the mine, farm, transport, trading, or Processor level \\n\\nof the Supply Chain: \\n- Conflict risks: Direct or indirect finance or benefit to armed groups that \\nare perpetrators of serious human rights abuses consistent with the \\nOECD Guidance, including in the DRC or an adjoining country.  \\n\\n- OECD Annex II and human rights risks: Forced labor, human trafficking, \\nthe worst forms of child labor, illegal taxation, and widespread gross \\nhuman rights abuses, including sexual violence, as well as other \\nhuman rights violations.

If you face a situation that \\nis not covered by this Code, ask yourself these questions to guide your actions: \\n\\nIs it legal according to the spirit, as well as the letter, of any law that may apply? \\nIs it ethical and consistent with the principles set forth in this Code and other Adobe policies? \\nWould you want your actions reported publicly? \\nWhat would your family, friends, manager, and co-workers think of your actions? \\nCould there be any direct or indirect negative consequences for Adobe? \\n\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n\\nOur Company Values  \\n\\n2.\\nActing with integrity is a fundamental part of Adobe’s culture and how we do business.  Our commitment to \\nbeing  fair  and  honest  is  how  we  maintain  trust  and  credibility  with  our  employees,  customers,  business \\npartners, stockholders, and communities where we operate.   \\n\\nAt Adobe, we embrace these company values:  \\n\\nCreativity is in our DNA. We constantly look around the corner to see what is possible. But we don\\'t wait for \\nthe future, we create it.   \\n\\nWe are builders, makers, and inventors, driven by a deep empathy for our customers and users.   \\n\\nWe  are  open-minded  and  celebrate  new  ideas.    We  have  the  courage  to  disrupt  the  market  and  ourselves \\nthrough bold bets and ideas we turn into reality. \\n\\nWe think and operate like owners.  We take initiative, have a bias toward action, and assume ownership for \\nend results, not just our part.   \\n\\nWe are reliable and have clear points of view. We\\'re decisive and learn from our mistakes. \\n\\nWe aim high and we play to win.  We relentlessly focus on execution, celebrate excellence and are \\nintellectually honest about where we must do better.  \\n\\nWe deliver both speed and quality by doing fewer things better. Our success is measured by the success of \\nour customers and users. \\n\\n April 2023 | 3 of 13 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cAdobe\\n\\nCode of Business Conduct  \\n\\nBUSINESS ETHICS \\nHOTLINE \\n\\n1-800-300-1026\\n\\n•\\n\\nCall \\nwithin the U.S. and \\nCanada \\n\\nYou will have the option \\nto remain anonymous to \\nthe extent permitted by \\napplicable law.  \\n\\nAll reports will be kept in \\nconfidence to the extent \\nappropriate and \\npermitted by law and \\nAdobe policies. \\n\\nThe ability to be yourself is core to who we are.

This  means  you  may  not  use  Adobe’s  assets  for  any \\nfunction that you are not authorized to perform, for any illegal purpose, or for any matter \\nthat violates the letter or spirit of this Code or other Adobe policies.   \\n\\nYou are responsible for any Adobe assets that are under your control.  It is important \\nthat  you  avoid  any  unauthorized  use,  alteration,  destruction,  disclosure,  distribution, \\ntheft, waste, or other carelessness when handling Adobe’s assets.  The improper use of \\nAdobe’s  assets  may  expose  both  you  and  Adobe  to  legal  liability  and  damaged \\nreputation, and result in disciplinary action, including termination of your employment \\nor affiliation with Adobe. \\n\\nAdobe’s  assets  include  tangible  assets  (such  as  office  equipment)  and  intangible  assets  (such  as  software \\nCompany Funds:\\nprograms; patents, trademarks, and copyrights; and proprietary and confidential information). \\n\\n  If you are authorized to use Adobe funds, you are expected to spend wisely and follow all \\napplicable procedures.  You should avoid waste and verify that Adobe gets proper value for any services or \\nproducts that you purchase.

Performing work for \\nHolding a Significant Investment in an entity that currently conducts or seeks to conduct business with \\nan Adobe competitor is not allowed under any circumstances.   \\nAdobe. \\n\\n  A  Significant  Investment  is  any  beneficial  ownership  or  financial  interest  that  could  influence,  or \\nreasonably appear to influence, your judgment or ability to act on behalf of Adobe, as defined in the Conflict \\nof  Interest  Master  Policy.    In  general,  Significant  Investments  will  only  be  permitted  if  you  do  not  have \\nresponsibility for any business relationship between the entity and Adobe.  You may not own, either directly \\nor indirectly, a Significant Investment in any entity that competes or is likely to compete with Adobe (with the \\nConducting  Adobe  business  with  related  parties,  such  as  a  family  member,  person  sharing  your \\nexception of owning stock in publicly traded companies).    \\nhousehold, or anyone else with whom you have a significant personal relationship.\\n\\n  You are responsible \\nfor avoiding situations where your personal relationships may create the appearance of a conflict of interest.  \\nFor example, you may be required to follow specific controls to avoid participating in or having influence over \\nany business relationship between your related party (or their employer) and Adobe.

U.S. law prohibits the purchase or sale of stocks or \\nderivative securities by any person in possession of Insider Information, and Adobe’s policy prohibits trading \\nin Adobe options and other derivative securities at any time.   \\n\\nIf you trade on the basis of Insider Information, or tip Insider Information to others, you may be personally \\nliable for civil and criminal fines and face the possibility of a jail sentence.  To help protect you from violating \\ninsider trading laws, Adobe has established quarterly trading window procedures that establish when you can \\nand cannot trade Adobe stock.  However, it is ultimately your responsibility to avoid trading any stock on the \\nbasis of Insider Information at any time, regardless of whether the trading window is open.     \\n\\nIf  you  have  questions  about  whether  a  transaction  is  legal  or  may  violate  insider  trading  laws,  promptly \\nconsult the Stock Trading Compliance Center on Inside Adobe or send your question to Trading@adobe.com.  \\n\\nSocial Media and Public Speaking \\n\\nAdobe  supports  the  appropriate  use  of  social  media  both  personally  and,  if  authorized,  on  behalf  of  the \\ncompany.  If you engage in social media, you are expected to always demonstrate good judgment and adhere \\nto Adobe’s key social principles of being authentic, involved, responsible, and respectful.  Remember that you \\nare responsible for what you say or post online. \\n\\nAll social media and social networking accounts created by Adobe employees that leverage Adobe’s brands or \\ntrademarks, or that are created using an Adobe business email address, are considered the property of Adobe.  \\nYou  must  be  authorized  by  Adobe’s  Social  Media  Center  of  Excellence  before  you  create  or  manage  these \\nAdobe-owned properties.

We believe \\nthat  open  competition  leads  to  a  vibrant  marketplace  where  consumers  benefit  from  lower  prices,  more \\nchoices, and better products and services. Violation of the competition and antitrust laws may expose Adobe \\nand you personally to criminal and civil penalties. We do not participate in activities that have the effect or \\nintent of reducing or destroying competition, such as agreeing with competitors to charge certain prices to \\ncustomers (price fixing), coordinating with competitors during competitive bidding processes (bid rigging), \\nor dividing up markets by region, product, or customer (market allocation).   \\n\\nWe  compete  fairly  and  on  the  merits,  and  we  avoid  business  practices  that  unfairly  exclude  or  foreclose \\ncompetitors from the marketplace. We do not enter into illegal agreements with our competitors, whether \\nformal or informal, written, or oral.  Before we form joint ventures with other third parties, we are cautious to \\nconsider whether the joint venture may have unlawful anticompetitive effects.   \\n\\nAlthough we compete vigorously, we play by the rules:   \\n\\n•\\n•\\n\\nWe gather competitive intelligence lawfully and without the use of deception.     \\nWe do not seek to acquire, use, or disclose a competitor’s trade secrets or confidential information.  \\nIf you receive confidential information about a competitor, even if accidentally or from an unknown \\nsource,  or  if  you  become  aware  or  suspect  that  someone  at  Adobe  has  received  confidential \\ninformation about a competitor, you must immediately contact your manager and either the Adobe \\nCompliance Office or Adobe Legal department to determine how to proceed. \\nWe communicate honestly, and we do not make false claims or comparisons about our competitors \\nor their products or services.   \\nWe conduct all interactions with competitors, including social activities, as if they were completely \\n•\\nin  the  public  view.

(“AWS”), Plaintiffs Dustin Curtis, Ursula N. Riley, \\n\\nHoward Chen, and Jarod Thrush allege on their own behalf and on behalf of all others similarly \\n\\nsituated, including the Class and State Subclasses described herein, as follows: \\n\\n1. \\n\\nA financial institution that purposefully collects and retains highly sensitive \\n\\npersonal information must protect the highly sensitive personal and financial information that it \\n\\ncollects from customers.  When personal information is collected by a financial institution as a \\n\\nrequirement to providing its services, the company and the cloud services company it utilizes \\n\\nmust be at the forefront of data security to ensure that thieves and hackers could never get access \\n\\nto the data the company has collected.  A financial institution and the company it contracts with \\n\\nto store information “in the cloud” cannot let security depend on the integrity of individual \\n\\ncontractors, consultants, or employees. A financial institution and its web services provider \\n\\ncannot fail to update to the latest security or patch critical software effectively and promptly, and \\n\\nthey cannot fail to invest in data security at sufficient levels to prevent unauthorized access to \\n\\ncustomer data.  A financial services company and its web services provider must have systems \\n\\nand resources in place to detect when its systems have been breached, instead of having to rely \\n\\non tips from anonymous “white hat” hackers to know when customer information is up for grabs. \\n\\nAnd when a data breach involving up to 106 million records of innocent customers occurs, a \\n\\nfinancial institution and its web services provider must immediately and accurately notify all \\n\\nthose affected to prevent consumers from becoming victims of identity theft. And they must take \\n\\nimmediate steps to mitigate the damages it has caused.  This lawsuit stems from Defendants’ \\n\\nfailure to follow these simple rules. \\n\\nI. \\n\\nFACTS \\n\\n2. \\n\\nCapital One is a worldwide financial services company.  Founded in 1994, in 25 \\n\\nyears it has become one of the largest financial institutions in the United States.

Capital \\n\\nOne’s revenues exceeded $28 billion in 2018.1 \\n\\nA. \\n\\nOn July 29, 2019, Capital One admitted that its cloud-based computer systems \\noperated by Amazon Web Services had been breached and data exfiltration had \\nbeen ongoing since March 2019. \\n\\n3. \\n\\nOn July 29, 2019, Capital One first disclosed that its computer systems had been \\n\\nhacked.  On its website and in press releases, the company stated: “there was unauthorized \\n\\naccess by an outside individual who obtained certain types of personal information relating to \\n\\npeople who had applied for its credit card products and to Capital One credit card customers.”2 \\n\\n4. \\n\\nAccording to Capital One, the Data Breach compromised “information on \\n\\nconsumers and small businesses as of the time they applied for one of our credit card products \\n\\nfrom 2005 through early 2019,” and included “names, addresses, zip codes/postal codes, phone \\n\\nnumbers, email addresses, dates of birth, . . . self-reported income[,] . . . credit scores, credit \\n\\nlimits, balances, payment history, contact information” and “transaction data.”3 \\n\\n5. \\n\\nThe reach included credit card application information for some 106 million \\n\\nconsumers and Capital One revealed that the Data Breach compromised the social security \\n\\nnumbers of approximately 140,000 of the bank’s credit card customers, and the bank account \\n\\nnumbers of approximately 80,000 of the bank’s secured credit card customers.4 \\n\\n6. \\n\\nCapital One was hacked by Paige A. Thompson, who also called herself “Erratic.” \\n\\nThompson had previously worked as a “systems engineer” for Defendant AWS. On July 29, \\n\\n2019, Thompson was arrested by the FBI and charged by federal prosecutors in the United States \\n\\nDistrict Court for the Western District of Washington. The charges included computer fraud and \\n\\nabuse in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(2). \\n\\n1 Capital One, 2018 Annual Report at 2 (Feb. 20, 2019), available at http://phx.corporate-\\nir.net/External.File?item=UGFyZW50SUQ9NzA1MTY4fENoaWxkSUQ9NDE3NTE3fFR5cG\\nU9MQ==&t=1. \\n\\n2 See Capital One, Information on the Capital One Cyber Incident (as of July 30, 2019), \\n\\nhttps://www.capitalone.com/facts2019/. \\n\\n3 Id. \\n4 Id. \\n\\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 2 \\nCase No. 19-cv-01366 \\n010841-11/1181064 V1 \\n\\n1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2000 • SEATTLE, WA 98101 \\n(206) 623-7292 • FAX (206) 623-0594 \\n\\n \\n \\n                                                 \\n\\x0cCase 2:19-cv-01366   Document 1   Filed 08/29/19   Page 7 of 42\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n26 \\n\\n27 \\n\\n28 \\n\\n7. \\n\\nIn its charging documents, the government alleged Thompson was able to gain \\n\\naccess to customers’ personal information (PII) that had been collected by Capital One and \\n\\nstored on Capital One’s cloud computing platform housed on Defendant Amazon Web Services \\n\\nsystem. Thompson exploited a “configuration vulnerability” to gain access to the systems.5 \\n\\nAccording to Capital One, this “unauthorized access also enabled the decrypting of data.”6 \\n\\n8. \\n\\nIn her attack, Thompson exploited a vulnerability known as Server-Side Request \\n\\nForgery (SSRF).7 Through an SSRF a hacker dupes a computer system into disclosing sensitive \\n\\nserver-side information that would otherwise be inaccessible outside the firewall. In this case, \\n\\nreports suggest that Thompson was able to use SSRF to execute a request on an AWS EC2 \\n\\ninstance controlled by Capital One that revealed Capital One’s S3 credentials.8 \\n\\n9. \\n\\nThis attack was possible due to a known vulnerability in AWS that allows SSRF \\n\\nattackers to trick AWS EC2 instances into disclosing users’ credentials. The command that \\n\\nexposes AWS credentials on any EC2 system is included in AWS online documentation and is \\n\\nwell known among hackers.9 Defendant AWS could have implemented changes to its platform to \\n\\nprotect its clients and its clients’ customers from hacking attacks like that perpetrated by \\n\\nThompson. \\n\\n10. \\n\\nThompson initially gained access to Capital One’s systems on March 22, 2019, \\n\\nand the breach continued through at least April 21, 2019.10 \\n\\n11. \\n\\nThompson was not secretive about her exploits. In a June 16, 2019 tweet, \\n\\nThompson described her method for gaining access to files stored on AWS S3 systems. \\n\\n5 Capital One, Frequently Asked Questions (as of July 30, 2019), \\n\\nhttps://www.capitalone.com/facts2019/2/. \\n\\n6 Id. \\n7 See Jared Perry, Early Lessons from the Capital One Data Breach, STRATUM SECURITY \\n(July 31, 2019), https://blog.stratumsecurity.com/2019/07/31/early-lessons-from-the-capital-one-\\nbreach/. \\n8 Id. \\n9 Id. \\n10 Id. \\n\\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 3 \\nCase No. 19-cv-01366 \\n010841-11/1181064 V1 \\n\\n1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2000 • SEATTLE, WA 98101 \\n(206) 623-7292 • FAX (206) 623-0594 \\n\\n \\n \\n                                                 \\n\\x0c1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n26 \\n\\n27 \\n\\n28 \\n\\nCase 2:19-cv-01366   Document 1   Filed 08/29/19   Page 8 of 42\\n\\nImportantly, this attack vector would not be limited to use on Capital One information. It could \\n\\nbe used against any company that used AWS to house its customer information. \\n\\n12. \\n\\nOn August 13, 2019, the Government filed a motion seeking to have Thompson \\n\\ndetained pending trial.11 In that motion the Government revealed that its investigation has so far \\n\\nidentified as many as 30 companies and educational institutions that Thompson may have hacked \\n\\nand whose customer data was discovered in Thompson’s residence.12 \\n\\n13. \\n\\nThompson executed her hacking attacks on multiple companies that used AWS, \\n\\nthrough a vector that was known to AWS.

There is, therefore, little question that Capital One and \\n\\nAWS did not to live up to their promises regarding data protection. \\n\\n17. \\n\\nConsumers have many choices for credit cards and they would not have chosen to \\n\\nprovide their PII to Capital One had they known that the information would be at heightened risk \\n\\nof compromise due to Capital One’s and AWS’ lax data security. \\n\\nC. \\n\\nPlaintiffs and other Nationwide Class members have suffered harm as a result of the \\ndata breach. \\n\\n18. \\n\\nAs a result of Defendants’ unfair, inadequate, and unreasonable data security, at \\n\\nleast one cyber-criminal and unknown others now possess the personal and financial information \\n\\nof Plaintiffs and the Class.  With account numbers, names, addresses, birthdates, and credit \\n\\ninformation, criminals can open entirely new credit accounts and bank accounts, and garner \\n\\nmillions through fraud that victims will not be able to detect until it is too late.  Victims’ credit \\n\\nprofiles can be destroyed and they will lose the ability to legitimately borrow money, obtain \\n\\ncredit, or even open bank accounts.   \\n\\n19. \\n\\nFurther, criminals can file false federal and state tax returns in victim’s names, \\n\\npreventing or at least delaying victims’ receipt of their legitimate tax refunds and potentially \\n\\nmaking victims targets of IRS and state tax investigations.  At the very least, victims must add \\n\\nthemselves to credit fraud watch lists, which substantially impair victims’ ability to obtain \\n\\nadditional credit.  Many experts advise a flat out freeze on all credit accounts, making it \\n\\nimpossible to rent a car, get student loans, or buy or rent furniture or a new TV, let alone \\n\\ncomplete a major purchase such as a new car or home, without taking the time to request that the \\n\\nfreeze be suspended, waiting the days it can take for that to occur, and then reinstating the freeze.  \\n\\nFurther, there are four major reporting agencies, so consumers may need to take these steps with \\n\\n14 AWS, Privacy Notice (last updated Dec. 10, 2018), https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/. \\n\\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 5 \\nCase No. 19-cv-01366 \\n010841-11/1181064 V1 \\n\\n1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2000 • SEATTLE, WA 98101 \\n(206) 623-7292 • FAX (206) 623-0594 \\n\\n \\n \\n                                                 \\n\\x0cCase 2:19-cv-01366   Document 1   Filed 08/29/19   Page 10 of 42\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n26 \\n\\n27 \\n\\n28 \\n\\nall of them because they will not know which bureau a creditor may consult.

A “cyber black-\\n\\nmarket” exists in which criminals openly post stolen credit card numbers, passport numbers, and \\n\\nother personal information on a number of Internet websites. A credit card number trades for \\n\\nunder $10 on the black market.  Magnetic track data increases the price, and a card with full \\n\\npersonal information such as an address, phone number, and email address (“fullz”) are traded at \\n\\naround $25 per record.15  \\n\\n21. \\n\\nBut this breach is far more valuable.  The data breach consists of over 106 million \\n\\nrecords that include at least name, address, birthdate, employment information, and account \\n\\nnumbers.  Complete identity records like those at issue here can sell for up to $200 on the black \\n\\nmarket, making this a breach potentially worth in excess of $20 billion to cybercriminals.16 \\n\\n22. \\n\\nThe personal and financial information that Defendants failed to adequately \\n\\nprotect, including Plaintiff’s identifying information, are “as good as gold” to identity thieves \\n\\nbecause identity thieves can use victims’ personal data to open new financial accounts and incur \\n\\ncharges in another person’s name, take out loans in another person’s name, incur charges on \\n\\nexisting accounts, and file false federal and state tax returns. \\n\\n23. \\n\\nAlthough Capital One is offering free credit monitoring to some customers, the \\n\\ncredit monitoring services do little to prevent wholesale identity theft.  Moreover, experts warn \\n\\nthat batches of stolen information will not be immediately dumped on the black market.  “[O]ne \\n\\nyear of credit monitoring may not be enough.

R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3), \\n\\nbecause the above common questions of law or fact predominate over any questions affecting \\n\\nindividual members of the Class, and a class action is superior to other available methods for the \\n\\nfair and efficient adjudication of this controversy. \\n\\n62. \\n\\nClass certification also is appropriate under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), because \\n\\nDefendants have acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the Class, so that final \\n\\ninjunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate as to the Nationwide Class as a \\n\\nwhole. \\n\\n63. \\n\\nThe expense and burden of litigation would substantially impair the ability of \\n\\nPlaintiffs and Nationwide Class members to pursue individual lawsuits to vindicate their rights.  \\n\\nAbsent a class action, Defendants will retain the benefits of its wrongdoing despite its serious \\n\\nviolations of the law. \\n\\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 13 \\nCase No. 19-cv-01366 \\n010841-11/1181064 V1 \\n\\n1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2000 • SEATTLE, WA 98101 \\n(206) 623-7292 • FAX (206) 623-0594 \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0c1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n26 \\n\\n27 \\n\\n28 \\n\\nCase 2:19-cv-01366   Document 1   Filed 08/29/19   Page 18 of 42\\n\\nV. \\n\\nCAUSES OF ACTION \\n\\nCOUNT I \\n\\nNEGLIGENCE \\n(BROUGHT BY ALL PLAINTIFFS ON THEIR OWN BEHALF AND  \\nON BEHALF OF THE NATIONWIDE CLASS, OR, ALTERNATIVELY,  \\nALL PLAINTIFFS ON THEIR OWN BEHALF AND ON BEHALF OF  \\nTHE STATE SUBCLASSES) \\n\\n64. \\n\\nPlaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations contained in the \\n\\npreceding paragraphs. \\n\\n65. \\n\\nPlaintiffs bring this count on their own behalf and on behalf of the Nationwide \\n\\nClass under the laws of the state of Washington or, alternatively, on their own behalf and on \\n\\nbehalf of the State Subclasses under the negligence laws of all 50 states and the District of \\n\\nColumbia. \\n\\n66. \\n\\nBy accepting and storing Plaintiffs’ and the Nationwide Class and State Subclass \\n\\nmembers’ non-public personal and financial information, including highly sensitive information \\n\\nsuch as names, dates of birth, email addresses, telephone numbers, credit card numbers, and \\n\\naccount numbers, Defendants assumed a duty, including a special or fiduciary duty, to all \\n\\nPlaintiffs and the Nationwide Class and State Subclass members requiring them to use \\n\\nreasonable and, at the very least, industry-standard care to secure such information against theft \\n\\nand misuse. \\n\\n67. \\n\\nDefendants breached their duty of care by failing to adequately secure and protect \\n\\nPlaintiffs’ and the Nationwide Class and State Subclass members’ personal and financial \\n\\ninformation from theft, access, collection, and misuse by third parties. \\n\\n68. \\n\\nFurther, Defendants breached their duty of care by failing to act to protect \\n\\nPlaintiffs’ and the Nationwide Class and State Subclass members’ personal and financial \\n\\ninformation, including, upon information and belief, by neglecting to promptly, completely, and \\n\\neffectively patch and repair its systems when initially advised of one or more critical flaws or \\n\\nvulnerabilities in the system and/or software, such that the referenced data breach has occurred. \\n\\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 14 \\nCase No. 19-cv-01366 \\n010841-11/1181064 V1 \\n\\n1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2000 • SEATTLE, WA 98101 \\n(206) 623-7292 • FAX (206) 623-0594 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0c1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n26 \\n\\n27 \\n\\n28 \\n\\nCase 2:19-cv-01366   Document 1   Filed 08/29/19   Page 19 of 42\\n\\n69. \\n\\nDefendants further breached their duty of care by failing to promptly, timely, \\n\\nclearly, accurately, and completely inform Plaintiffs and the Class that their personal and \\n\\nfinancial information had been stolen. \\n\\n70. \\n\\nPlaintiffs and members of the Nationwide Class and State Subclasses have \\n\\nsuffered injury in fact, including monetary damages, and will continue to be injured and incur \\n\\ndamages as a result of Defendants’ negligence and misconduct. \\n\\n71. \\n\\nAs a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ failure to take reasonable care and \\n\\nuse adequate and at least industry-standard measures to protect the personal information placed \\n\\nin its care, Plaintiffs and members of the Nationwide Class and State Subclasses had their \\n\\npersonal and financial information stolen, causing direct and measurable monetary losses, threat \\n\\nof future losses, identity theft, and threat of identity theft. \\n\\n72. \\n\\nAs a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ negligence and misconduct, \\n\\nPlaintiffs and members of the Nationwide Class and State Subclasses were injured in fact by: \\n\\nidentity theft;

See, e.g., Restatement (Third) \\n\\nof Restitution and Unjust Enrichment § 39(1) (2011) (supporting claims under the opportunistic \\n\\nbreach theory of restitution, which provides a claim for relief when a deliberate breach of \\n\\ncontract results in profit to the defaulting promisor and the available damage remedy affords \\n\\ninadequate protection to the promisee’s contractual entitlement, measured by the profit realized \\n\\nby the defaulting promisor).   \\n\\n99. \\n\\nAs alleged herein, Defendants have unjustly received and retained monetary \\n\\nbenefits from Plaintiffs and the proposed Class, such that inequity has resulted. \\n\\n100.   By engaging in the conduct described in this complaint, Defendants knowingly \\n\\nobtained benefits from Plaintiffs and the proposed class as alleged herein under circumstances \\n\\nsuch that it would be inequitable and unjust for Defendants to retain them. \\n\\n101.  By engaging in the acts and failures to act described in this complaint, Defendants \\n\\nhave been knowingly enriched by the savings in costs that should have been reasonably \\n\\nexpended to protect the data of Plaintiffs and the proposed class.  Defendants were on notice that \\n\\ngathering and transmittal of their customers’ data could happen yet they failed to take reasonable \\n\\nsteps to pay for the level of security required to have prevented such unauthorized access, \\n\\ngathering, and transmittal to third parties. \\n\\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 21 \\nCase No. 19-cv-01366 \\n010841-11/1181064 V1 \\n\\n1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2000 • SEATTLE, WA 98101 \\n(206) 623-7292 • FAX (206) 623-0594 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCase 2:19-cv-01366   Document 1   Filed 08/29/19   Page 26 of 42\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n26 \\n\\n27 \\n\\n28 \\n\\n102.

Thus, Defendants will be unjustly enriched if they are permitted to retain the \\n\\nbenefits derived from the unauthorized and impermissible gathering and sharing of Plaintiffs and \\n\\nthe proposed class’s data.  \\n\\n104.

Affected individuals across the country began filing class action \\n\\nlawsuits against Capital One and Amazon. Ultimately, more than 60 such lawsuits were filed. In \\n\\nOctober  2019,  the  Judicial  Panel  on  Multidistrict  Litigation  consolidated  and  transferred  these \\n\\nlawsuits to this Court for pre-trial proceedings (the “Action”). \\n\\nOn December 2, 2019, the Court appointed Norman E. Siegel, Karen Hanson Riebel, and \\n\\n1 Plaintiffs have also filed their Unopposed Motion for an Award of Attorneys’ Fees, Costs and Expenses, and for \\nPlaintiff Service Awards, Docs. 2230, 2231, which the Court took under advisement following the hearing on \\nSeptember 8, 2022. \\n2 All capitalized terms not otherwise defined have the meanings set forth in the Settlement Agreement.

Doc.  210, \\n\\nPretrial  Order  #3.  On  January  29,  2020,  the  Court  approved  a  representative  complaint  as  the \\n\\nvehicle for litigating Plaintiffs’ claims (Doc. 302), which the Plaintiffs filed on March 2, 2020 (the \\n\\n“Representative  Complaint”).  The  91-page  Representative  Complaint  named  Representative \\n\\nPlaintiffs  from  the  states  of  California,  Florida,  New  York,  Texas,  Virginia,  and  Washington, \\n\\nasserting representative common law claims on behalf of a nationwide class against Capital One \\n\\nand Amazon for negligence, negligence per se, unjust enrichment, breach of express and implied \\n\\ncontract, and declaratory judgment, and state statutory claims under state data breach notification \\n\\nand consumer protection statutes on behalf of state subclasses. Doc. 332, Doc. 354 (corrected).3\\n\\nOn  April  10,  2020,  Capital  One  and  Amazon  each  filed  motions  to  dismiss  the \\n\\nRepresentative Complaint in its entirety. Docs. 386-87, 389-90. Plaintiffs filed opposition briefs \\n\\nto which Defendants replied. See Docs. 426, 427 (Plaintiffs’ Memoranda in Opposition); Docs. \\n\\n463, 464 (Defendants’ Replies). On May 27, 2020, the Court heard oral argument on Defendants’ \\n\\nmotions to dismiss. See Doc. 494. Those motions were granted in part and denied in part. \\n\\nOn September 18, 2020, the Court issued a ruling granting in part and otherwise denying \\n\\nthe  motions.  Doc.  879.  However,  briefing  related  to  Representative  Plaintiffs’  allegations \\n\\ncontinued for months thereafter. On October 2, 2020, Capital One asked the Court to reconsider \\n\\none of its rulings—that the Representative Plaintiffs had sufficiently alleged Capital One assumed \\n\\na duty of care to them in tort under Virginia law, and alternatively asked the Court to certify this \\n\\nquestion to the Virginia Supreme Court. Doc. 916. Plaintiffs submitted opposition briefing, and \\n\\nthe  Court  denied  the  motion  for  reconsideration.  Doc.  934  (Plaintiffs’  Opposition);  Doc.  951 \\n\\n3 Three of the Representative Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their claims without prejudice to their ability to submit \\nclaims as absent class members (Docs. 399, 436, 852) and two new Representative Plaintiffs were substituted, \\nultimately resulting in the eight current Representative Plaintiffs who are the Settlement Class Representatives under \\nthe settlement.

Later, after \\n\\nconcluding  Virginia  law  applied  as  to  all  Representative  Plaintiffs’  common  law  claims  (Doc. \\n\\n1293; Doc. 879 at 9), the Court granted Capital One’s request to certify the question of tort duty \\n\\nto the Virginia Supreme Court. Doc. 1291. The Virginia Supreme Court subsequently declined to \\n\\naccept the certified question. Doc. 1380. \\n\\nOn October 16, 2020,  Defendants each  filed Answers.  Docs.  953,  955.  On October 30, \\n\\n2020,  Capital  One  moved  for  judgment  on  the  pleadings  on  Representative  Plaintiffs’  unjust \\n\\nenrichment  and  implied  contract  claims  (Doc.  996),  which  Plaintiffs  opposed.  Doc.  1032 \\n\\n(Plaintiffs’ Opposition); Doc. 1060 (Capital One’s Reply). After a hearing, the Court denied the \\n\\nmotion. Doc. 1096 (12/09/2020 Hr’g Tr.); Doc. 1290 (Order denying). \\n\\nMeanwhile,  as  motion  practice  related  to  Representative  Plaintiffs’  allegations  was \\n\\nunderway,  the  Parties  were  engaged  in  discovery.  Plaintiffs  served  several  rounds  of  written \\n\\ndiscovery on Defendants and eighteen third-party subpoenas, including six subpoenas to former \\n\\nCapital One employees, and reviewed over 350,000 documents—totaling nearly 3 million pages— \\n\\nproduced by Defendants and nearly 7,500 documents produced by third parties. See Doc. 2219-4, \\n\\nClass Counsel Decl.  ¶ 20. Plaintiffs also took 33 depositions of Defendants’ fact witnesses, 13 \\n\\ndepositions  of  Defendants’  Rule  30(b)(6)  witnesses,  and  two  third-party  depositions.  Id.  In \\n\\naddition, Defendants also served written discovery requests on the Plaintiffs, requiring searches of \\n\\nPlaintiffs’ electronic documents in addition to the collection and review of physical documents. \\n\\nPlaintiffs ultimately produced nearly 1,750 documents totaling over 7,500 pages in 54 document \\n\\nproductions after collecting and reviewing over 145,000 documents from 24 custodians. Id. ¶  21. \\n\\nFurthermore, discovery involved the completion and collection of a verified “Fact Sheet,” \\n\\nincluding ten pages of questions and eight document requests, to MDL Plaintiffs. Ultimately, 101 \\n\\nMDL  Plaintiffs  submitted  verified  Fact  Sheets  and  responsive  documents,  while  147  MDL \\n\\n3 \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cCase 1:19-cv-02939-AJT-JFA   Document 126   Filed 09/13/22   Page 4 of 25 PageID# 467\\n\\nPlaintiffs chose to dismiss their pending complaints.4 Id. In May 2020, each of the Representative \\n\\nPlaintiffs  sat  for  remote  depositions.  Id.  ¶  22.  In  addition,  Defendants  deposed  nine  additional \\n\\nMDL Plaintiffs. All of this discovery involved significant motion practice before Judge Anderson. \\n\\nAfter discovery closed in late 2020 and expert disclosures were completed in the spring of \\n\\n2021, on April 28, 2021, Plaintiffs filed their Motion for Class Certification, seeking certification \\n\\nof a nationwide class of approximately 98 million Americans. Docs. 1259, 1261. This motion was \\n\\nfully briefed on June 18, 2021. See Doc. 1443 (Capital One’s Opposition); Doc. 1435 (Amazon’s \\n\\nOpposition); Doc. 1558 (Plaintiffs’ Reply as to Capital One); Doc. 1571 (Plaintiffs’ Reply as to \\n\\nAmazon). \\n\\nDefendants each filed several Daubert challenges related to Plaintiffs’ class certification \\n\\nmotion, which Plaintiffs opposed, and which were fully briefed by July 2, 2021. Docs. 1389, 1390, \\n\\n1394, 1395, 1397, 1398, 1427, 1428, 1431, 1432 (Defendants’ motions to exclude and memoranda \\n\\nin support); Docs. 1528, 1534, 1540, 1546, 1552 (Plaintiffs’ Oppositions); Docs. 1607, 1609, 1611, \\n\\n1633, 1647 (Defendants’ Replies). Plaintiffs also moved to exclude one of Capital One’s experts \\n\\nrelated to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification. Docs. 1559-60. \\n\\nThe Court held a two-day hearing on July 12 and 13, 2021 on Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class \\n\\nCertification, the various related Daubert challenges, and Capital One’s challenge to the Court’s \\n\\njurisdiction to adjudicate Representative Plaintiffs’ tort and statutory claims. Docs. 1745, 1747; \\n\\nDocs.  1901-1902  (7/12-13/21  Hr’g  Tr.).  Soon  thereafter,  briefing  on  dispositive  motions \\n\\ncommenced.  On  June  3,  2021,  Capital  One  filed  its  motion  for  summary  judgment  seeking \\n\\njudgment on each of Representative Plaintiffs’ claims on several bases. Docs. 1460, 1463. That \\n\\nmotion was fully briefed. Doc. 1807. \\n\\n4 Of the 101 MDL Plaintiffs who submitted verified Fact Sheets and documents, an additional 32 eventually chose to \\ndismiss their pending complaints. \\n\\n4 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCase 1:19-cv-02939-AJT-JFA   Document 126   Filed 09/13/22   Page 5 of 25 PageID# 468\\n\\nOn July  2, 2021,  the Representative Plaintiffs moved for partial  summary judgment on \\n\\ntheir claims for breach of express and implied contract against Capital One.  Docs. 1646, 1649. \\n\\nThat motion was fully briefed. On the same day, Amazon moved for summary judgment  on each \\n\\nof Representative Plaintiffs’ claims. Docs. 1678, 1693. That motion was fully briefed. Doc. 1820. \\n\\nCapital One and Amazon also filed additional Daubert motions in connection with summary \\n\\njudgment,  which  Plaintiffs opposed. Docs. 1658, 1674, 1828, 1840.  Plaintiffs filed a motion \\n\\nto exclude the testimony of one of Capital One’s experts related to summary judgment. \\n\\nDocs. 1638, 1640. These Daubert motions were fully briefed on August 23, 2021. \\n\\nOn September 30, 2021, the Court held a full-day summary judgment hearing, including \\n\\nadditional argument on Capital One’s jurisdictional challenge. Doc. 2027 (9/30/21 Hr’g Tr.). At \\n\\nthe time of settlement, the motions for class certification, summary judgment, to exclude expert \\n\\ntestimony, and to challenge Plaintiffs’ Article III standing were submitted to the Court and under \\n\\nadvisement. \\n\\nParallel  to  their  litigation  of  the  Actions,  the  Parties  engaged  in  settlement  negotiations \\n\\nbeginning in March 2020. The negotiations were first overseen by former United States District \\n\\nCourt  Judge  Layn  R.  Phillips  and  later  overseen  by  United  States  District  Judge  Leonie  M. \\n\\nBrinkema.  The  Parties  engaged  in  four  mediation  sessions,  on  March  21,  2020,  November  18, \\n\\n2020,  April  16,  2021,  and  August  3,  2021,  with  Judge  Brinkema  presiding  over  the  last  three \\n\\nconferences. On December 17, 2021, the Parties executed a binding term sheet, to be  superseded \\n\\nby the Settlement Agreement. Doc. 2219-4, Class Counsel’s Declaration ¶ 30. The Parties signed \\n\\nthe Settlement Agreement on January 31, 2022. Dkt. 2219-1. \\n\\nOn February 7, 2022, the Court granted Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Approval and \\n\\nto Direct Notice. In its order (Doc. 2220), the Court found at that time that the Settlement terms \\n\\nnegotiated by the Parties appeared fair, reasonable, and adequate under Rule 23(e) and that the \\n\\n5 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCase 1:19-cv-02939-AJT-JFA   Document 126   Filed 09/13/22   Page 6 of 25 PageID# 469\\n\\nClass Representatives and Class Counsel have adequately represented the Class. Accordingly, the \\n\\nCourt held that it would likely be able to certify the proposed Settlement Class under Rule 23(b)(3) \\n\\nand directed the Parties to issue notice to putative class members. Pursuant to the Court’s direction, \\n\\nthe Claims Administrator appointed by the Court implemented a robust notice program, and the \\n\\nclaims process is ongoing. \\n\\nIn accordance with the Court’s order, direct mail and email notice to Class Members was \\n\\nserved. The notice informed Class Members of the terms of the Settlement, including instructions \\n\\nfor submitting a claim for cash reimbursement for out-of-pocket losses and time spent addressing \\n\\nissues related to the Data Breach. The notice further informed Class Members of the deadline to \\n\\nsubmit an objection to the Settlement or to opt out from the Settlement and that Class Counsel \\n\\nwould  seek  attorneys’  fees  of  up  to  35%  of  the  Settlement  Fund,  reimbursement  for  costs  and \\n\\nexpenses, and service awards of $5,000 for each of the Named Plaintiffs. The Notice Plan has been \\n\\nsuccessfully implemented and reached approximately 96 percent of the Settlement Class by the \\n\\nindividual notice efforts alone. Azari Decl., Ex. 1 to memorandum in support, ¶¶ 8-23, 40. Targeted \\n\\ninternet advertising and extensive news coverage enhanced public awareness of the Settlement. \\n\\nAzari Decl. ¶¶ 24-29, 40. \\n\\nAfter completion of the ordered class notice, hundreds of thousands of Settlement Class \\n\\nMembers filed claims, and Class Counsel expects that every Class Member submitting a valid, \\n\\nOut-Of-Pocket Loss claim will be completely (or nearly completely) reimbursed for losses that the \\n\\nClass Member believes are fairly traceable to the Data Breach. Conversely, only 4 Class Members \\n\\nsubmitted substantive objections—or just .000004% of the class.5 \\n\\n5 Class Counsel have applied separately for a fee of 33.3% of the Settlement Fund, or $63,270,000, and reimbursement \\nof litigation expenses of $2,345,821.98. See generally Docs. 2230, 2231 and Class Counsel Supplemental Decl., Ex. 4 to \\nmemorandum in support, ¶¶ 5-6. Class Counsel have also requested service awards of $5,000 each for the eight Settlement \\nClass Representatives and the nine other MDL Plaintiffs who were deposed by Capital One. (Id.) Capital One takes no \\nposition on these requests. \\n\\n6 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCase 1:19-cv-02939-AJT-JFA   Document 126   Filed 09/13/22   Page 7 of 25 PageID# 470\\n\\nFINAL APPROVAL AND JUDGMENT \\n\\nNothing has occurred that would alter the Court’s initial determination that the Settlement \\n\\nis  fair,  reasonable,  and  adequate.  In  fact,  the  response  of  the  class  members  to  the  Settlement \\n\\nfurther underscores that the Settlement is, in fact, fair, reasonable, and adequate. Therefore, the \\n\\nCourt, having  reviewed  the Settlement  Agreement and Release, including the exhibits  attached \\n\\nthereto  (together,  the  “Settlement  Agreement”  or  “Settlement”),  the  arguments  and  authorities \\n\\npresented by the Parties and their counsel, and the record in the Action, and good cause appearing, \\n\\nhereby grants final approval of the Settlement. \\n\\nAccordingly, \\n\\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED: \\n\\n1. \\n\\nClass Certification for Settlement Purposes Only. \\n\\nThe Settlement Agreement provides for a Settlement Class defined as follows: \\n\\nThe approximately 98 million U.S. residents identified by Capital One whose \\ninformation was compromised in the Data Breach that Capital One announced on \\nJuly 29, 2019, as reflected in the Class List. \\n\\nExcluded from the Settlement Class are (i) Capital One, any entity in which Capital One has \\n\\na  controlling  interest,  and  Capital  One’s  officers,  directors,  legal  representatives,  Successors, \\n\\nSubsidiaries, and assigns; (ii) any judge, justice, or judicial officer presiding over the Action and \\n\\nthe members of their immediate families and judicial staff; and (iii) any individual who timely and \\n\\nvalidly opted out of the Settlement Class. Doc. 2219-1, § 2.39. \\n\\nFor the following reasons, the Court affirms that it is proper to certify, and hereby does \\n\\nfinally certify, for settlement purposes only, the Settlement Class pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \\n\\nProcedure 23(b)(3). \\n\\na. \\n\\nNumerosity:  Rule  23(a)(1)  requires  that  a  proposed  settlement  class  be  “so \\n\\nnumerous that joinder of all class members is impracticable.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1). Here, there \\n\\n7 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCase 1:19-cv-02939-AJT-JFA   Document 126   Filed 09/13/22   Page 8 of 25 PageID# 471\\n\\nare approximately 98 million Settlement Class Members and numerosity is not in question. See \\n\\nJeffreys v. Commc’ns Workers of Am., AFL–CIO, 212 F.R.D. 320, 322 (E.D. Va. 2003) (noting \\n\\nthat  “where  the  class  numbers  twenty-five  or  more,  joinder  is  generally  presumed  to  be \\n\\nimpracticable”). \\n\\nb. \\n\\nCommonality:  Rule  23(a)(2)  requires  that  there  be  “questions  of  law  or  fact \\n\\ncommon to the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2). “Commonality requires the plaintiff to demonstrate \\n\\nthat the class members have suffered the same injury,” such that “all their claims can productively \\n\\nbe  litigated  at  once.”  Wal-Mart  Stores,  Inc.  v.  Dukes,  564  U.S.  338,  349-350  (2011)  (internal \\n\\nquotations and  citations omitted). This  requires  that  the  determination of  the  common question \\n\\n“will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.” Id.  at \\n\\n350. “Even a single common question will do.” Id. at 359 (internal quotations omitted). Here, all \\n\\nSettlement Class Members suffered the same alleged injury from the same conduct—exposure of \\n\\ntheir  personal  data  in  the  Data  Breach—and  are  asserting  the  same  legal  claims.  Accordingly, \\n\\ncommon questions of law and fact abound. See, e.g., Abubaker v. Dominion Dental USA, Inc., No. \\n\\n1:19-cv-01050, 2021 WL 6750844, at *3 (E.D. Va. Nov. 19, 2021) (Brinkema, J.); In re Equifax \\n\\nInc. Customer Data Security Breach Litig., No. 1:17-md-2800-TWT, 2020 WL 256132, at *11-12 \\n\\n(N.D. Ga. March 17, 2020), aff’d in relevant part 999 F.3d 1247 (11th Cir. 2021), cert. denied sub \\n\\nnom. Huang v. Spector, 142 S. Ct. 431 (2021), and cert. denied sub nom. Watkins v. Spector, 142 \\n\\nS. Ct. 765 (2022); In re Anthem, Inc. Data Breach Litig., 327 F.R.D. 299, 307-09 (N.D. Cal. 2018). \\n\\nc. \\n\\nTypicality: Rule 23(a)(3) requires that “the claims or defenses of the representative \\n\\nparties [be] typical of the claims or defenses of the class.” Typicality under Rule 23(a)(3) requires \\n\\nan inquiry into the “representative parties’ ability to represent a class.” Deiter v. Microsoft \\n\\nCorp., 436 F.3d 461, 466 (4th Cir. 2006). “The premise of the typicality requirement is simply \\n\\nstated: as goes the claim of the named plaintiff, so go the claims of the class.” Broussard v. Meineke \\n\\n8 \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cCase 1:19-cv-02939-AJT-JFA   Document 126   Filed 09/13/22   Page 9 of 25 PageID# 472\\n\\nDisc.  Muffler  Shops,  Inc.,  155  F.3d  331,  340  (4th  Cir.  1998)  (internal  quotations  and  citations \\n\\nomitted). In other words, the “plaintiff’s claim cannot be so different from the claims of absent \\n\\nclass members that their claims will not be advanced by plaintiff’s proof of his own individual \\n\\nclaim.” Deiter, 436 F.3d at 466-67. The Settlement Class Representatives’ claims are typical of \\n\\nother Settlement Class Members’ claims because they arise from the same Data Breach and involve \\n\\nthe same overarching legal theories, including the theories that Capital One breached its contracts \\n\\nwith Settlement Class Representatives and Settlement Class Members and failed in its common-\\n\\nlaw  duty  to  protect  their  personal  information.  See,  e.g.,  Dominion,  2021  WL  6750844,  at  *3; \\n\\nEquifax, 2020 WL 256132, at *12. \\n\\nd. \\n\\nAdequacy  of  Representation:  The  adequacy  requirement  is  satisfied  when  “the \\n\\nrepresentative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. \\n\\n23(a)(4). “The adequacy inquiry serves to uncover conflicts of interest between named parties and \\n\\nthe class they seek to represent.” Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 625 (1997). As noted \\n\\nabove, the Settlement Class Representatives do not have any interests antagonistic to other Settlement Class \\n\\nMembers and have retained lawyers who the Court has already recognized are abundantly qualified and \\n\\nexperienced, thus satisfying the adequacy requirement. Doc. 2219-4, ¶¶ 3-9, 50. \\n\\ne. \\n\\nPredominance: The predominance requirement “tests whether proposed classes are \\n\\nsufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication by representation.” Amchem, 521 U.S. at 623. “If the \\n\\n‘qualitatively  overarching  issue’  in  the  litigation  is  common,  a  class  may  be  certified \\n\\nnotwithstanding the need to resolve individualized issues.” Soutter v. Equifax Info. Servs., LLC, \\n\\n307 F.R.D 183, 214 (E.D. Va. 2015) (citing Ealy v. Pinkerton Gov’t Servs., 514 Fed. App’x 299, \\n\\n305 (4th Cir. 2013)). Common liability issues often predominate where class members “all assert \\n\\ninjury from the same action.” Gray v. Hearst Commc’ns, Inc., 444 Fed. App’x 698, 701-02 (4th \\n\\nCir.  2011);  see  also  Stillmock  v.  Weis  Markets,  Inc.,  385  Fed.  App’x  267,  273  (4th  Cir.  2010) \\n\\n9 \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cCase 1:19-cv-02939-AJT-JFA   Document 126   Filed 09/13/22   Page 10 of 25 PageID# 473\\n\\n(finding common issues predominated where class members were exposed to “the identical risk of \\n\\nidentity theft in the identical manner by the repeated identical conduct of the same defendant.”). \\n\\nHere, common questions predominate because all claims arise out of a common course of \\n\\nconduct by Capital One and the only significant individual issues involve damages, which rarely \\n\\npresent predominance problems. See, e.g., Dominion, 2021 WL 6750844, at *3; Equifax, 2020 WL \\n\\n256132, at *13; Anthem, 327 F.R.D. at 311-15. The focus on a defendant’s security measures in a \\n\\ndata  breach  class  action  “is  the  precise  type  of  predominant  question  that  makes  class-wide \\n\\nadjudication worthwhile.” Anthem, 327 F.R.D. at 312. Further, the Court  previously found that \\n\\nVirginia law applies across all common law claims, e.g., Plaintiffs’ claims for breach of contract \\n\\n(Doc. 879 at 9) and Plaintiffs’ tort and quasi-contract claims (Doc. 1293), such that any “variations \\n\\nin state law will not predominate over the common questions.” Equifax, 2020 WL 256132, at *13. \\n\\nf. \\n\\nSuperiority: “[T]he purpose of the superiority requirement is to assure that the class \\n\\naction is the most efficient and effective means of resolving the controversy.” 7AA Charles Wright, \\n\\nArthur Miller & Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1779 (3d ed. 2005). Litigating \\n\\nthe same claims of 98 million Americans through individual litigation would clearly be inefficient. \\n\\nThe superiority requirement thus is satisfied. See Equifax, 2020 WL 256132, at *14; Anthem, 327 \\n\\nF.R.D. at 315-16. \\n\\n2. \\n\\n Plaintiffs’ Counsel and Settlement Class Representatives. \\n\\nThe Court concludes that Norman E. Siegel of Stueve Siegel Hanson LLP, Karen Hanson \\n\\nRiebel  of  Lockridge  Grindal  Nauen,  P.L.L.P.,  and  John  A.  Yanchunis  of  Morgan  &  Morgan \\n\\nComplex Litigation Group have fairly and adequately represented the interests of the Settlement \\n\\nClass Members. Plaintiffs’ Counsel have substantial experience in consumer class action litigation, \\n\\nand in particular data breach and privacy litigation, lead a significant effort to well develop every \\n\\naspect of this case up through  the certification  and summary  judgment stage, and  were  able to \\n\\n10 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCase 1:19-cv-02939-AJT-JFA   Document 126   Filed 09/13/22   Page 11 of 25 PageID# 474\\n\\nnegotiate a well-informed Settlement that provides meaningful relief to Plaintiffs and the Class. \\n\\nThe  Court  previously  appointed  Mr.  Siegel,  Ms.  Riebel,  and  Mr.  Yanchunis  as  interim  Class \\n\\nCounsel and now  appoints them as Class  Counsel  pursuant to  Federal  Rule  of Civil  Procedure \\n\\n23(g). \\n\\nThe Court further concludes that Plaintiffs Brandon Hausauer, Carolyn Tada, Emily Behar, \\n\\nGary Zielicke, Emily Gershen, Brandi Edmondson, John Spacek, and Sara Sharp have fairly and \\n\\nadequately represented the interests of the Settlement Class Members and now appoints them as \\n\\nSettlement Class Representatives. \\n\\n3. \\n\\nJurisdiction. \\n\\nThe Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d)(2), and personal \\n\\njurisdiction over the parties before it. Additionally, venue is proper in this District pursuant to 28 \\n\\nU.S.C. § 1391. \\n\\n4. \\n\\nFindings Concerning Article III Standing. \\n\\nThis Court must assure itself of the Plaintiffs’ “standing under Article III,” which “extends \\n\\nto  court  approval  of  proposed  class  action  settlements.”  Frank  v. Gaos,  139  S.  Ct.  1041,  1046 \\n\\n(2019)  (per  curiam).  As  set  forth  in  the  Court’s  order  granting  preliminary  approval  of  the \\n\\nSettlement, to have standing to sue in federal court a plaintiff must have “‘(1) suffered an injury- \\n\\nin-fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely \\n\\nto be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.’” Doc. 2220 at 4-5 (quoting Hutton v. Nat’l Bd. \\n\\nOf Exam’rs in Optometry, Inc., 892 F.3d 613, 619 (4th Cir. 2018) (citation omitted)). \\n\\nThe Court reaffirms its prior conclusion that it has subject matter jurisdiction to approve \\n\\nthe Settlement. See Doc. 2220. The Court previously concluded it had subject matter jurisdiction \\n\\nto  approve  the  Settlement  because,  among  other  reasons,  each  Plaintiff  and  Settlement  Class \\n\\nMember is a party to an alleged contract under which Capital One agreed to provide safeguards \\n\\n11 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCase 1:19-cv-02939-AJT-JFA   Document 126   Filed 09/13/22   Page 12 of 25 PageID# 475\\n\\nfor their personal information, which Capital One allegedly breached, resulting in the theft of their \\n\\npersonal information. Doc. 2220 at 5-6 (citing L-3 Commc’ns Corp. v. Serco, Inc., 673 Fed. App’x \\n\\n284, 289 (4th Cir. 2016) (the existence of an express or implied contract, and the asserted breach \\n\\nthereof,  provides  the  plaintiff  standing  to  sue));  Friends  of  the  Earth,  Inc.  v.  Gaston  Copper \\n\\nRecycling Corp., 204 F.3d 149, 154 (4th Cir. 2000) (“[T]here is scant need for courts to pause over \\n\\nthe standing inquiry” for a breach of contract claim, because it is “readily” apparent that “a  party \\n\\nto a breached contract bears the kind of claim that he may press in court.”).6 Indeed, the Settlement \\n\\nClass  is  defined  to  include  only  individuals  whose  information  was  compromised  in  the  Data \\n\\nBreach  and  who  were  allegedly  parties  to  Capital  One’s  contracts  creating  enforceable  data \\n\\nsecurity commitments that were violated. See Doc. 971 ¶¶ 96, 212-227; Doc. 1648 at 2-3 & n.4, \\n\\n25-26 & nn.18-20; Doc. 1649 at 3-5; Doc. 879 at 41-42, 46-47. Thus, all Settlement Class Members \\n\\nhave Article III standing.7 The Court concludes it has subject matter jurisdiction to approve the \\n\\nSettlement and enter final judgment thereon. \\n\\n5. \\n\\nFindings Concerning Notice. \\n\\nThe  Court  finds  that  the  Notice  Program  has  been  implemented  by  the  Settlement \\n\\nAdministrator and the Parties in accordance with the requirements of the Settlement Agreement, \\n\\nand that such Notice Program, including the utilized forms of Notice, constitutes the best notice \\n\\npracticable under the circumstances and satisfies due process and the requirements of Rule 23 of \\n\\n6 Although Capital One disputes the merits of Plaintiffs’ claims for breach of express and implied contract, a challenge \\nto the merits does not impact the Court’s subject matter jurisdiction. See, e.g., Am. Civ. Liberties Union v. Mote, 423 \\nF.3d 438, 441 n.1 (4th Cir. 2005). Moreover, because approval of a settlement agreement is “not a substantive \\nadjudication of the underlying causes of action,” Marshall v. Nat’l Football League, 787 F.3d 502, 511 n.4 (8th Cir. \\n2015), the Court need not definitively determine whether Plaintiffs and the Settlement Class Members have in fact \\nproven their claims. As the Fifth Circuit observed, “it would make no practical sense for a court to require evidence of a \\nparty’s claims when the parties themselves seek settlement under Rule 23(e).” See In re Deepwater Horizon, 739 F.3d \\n790, 807 (5th Cir. 2014). Requiring class members “to prove their claims prior to settlement under Rule 23(e) would \\neliminate class settlement because there would be no need to settle a claim that was already proven.” Id. \\n7 Prior to reaching the Settlement now before the Court, the Parties argued extensively about the impact of TransUnion \\nLLC v. Ramirez, 141 S. Ct. 2190 (2021), on Plaintiffs’ Article III standing. Ramirez did not address standing in the \\ncontext of a class action settlement, let alone one that was reached prior to any ruling on class certification or summary \\njudgment. Even if Ramirez requires Settlement Class Members to have standing, that requirement is satisfied here. \\n\\n12 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCase 1:19-cv-02939-AJT-JFA   Document 126   Filed 09/13/22   Page 13 of 25 PageID# 476\\n\\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The Court finds that the Settlement Administrator and Parties \\n\\nhave complied with the  directives of the Order Granting Preliminary Approval of Class Action \\n\\nSettlement  and  Directing  Notice  of  Proposed  Settlement  and  the  Court  reaffirms  its  findings \\n\\nconcerning notice as set forth in paragraph 9 thereof. \\n\\n6. \\n\\nFindings Concerning Claims Process. \\n\\nThe Court finally approves the Claims Process as a fair and reasonable method to allocate \\n\\nthe Settlement benefits among Settlement Class Members. The Court directs that the Settlement \\n\\nAdministrator continue to effectuate the Claims Process according to the terms of the Settlement \\n\\nAgreement. \\n\\n7. \\n\\nObjections to the Settlement.8 \\n\\nOnly 4 Class Members submitted substantive objections, on the basis of which the Court \\n\\nfinds strong support for the Settlement by Settlement Class Members and weighs strongly in favor \\n\\nof final approval. \\n\\nAs  an  initial  matter,  the  Court  notes  that  Putative  class  members  Rosemary  Burnham \\n\\nMcDaniel (Doc. 2237) and Greg Zoccali (Doc. 2240) have opted-out of the Settlement and are \\n\\ntherefore not part of the Settlement Class and have no standing to object.9 The filing from Raymond \\n\\nJohn  (Doc.  2239,  filed  under  seal  because  of  personal  identifiers  on  documents),  contains  no \\n\\ndiscernable substantive objection to the Settlement. \\n\\nWith respect to the four remaining objections, which are more substantive in nature, the \\n\\nCourt overrules the objections of Steven Helfand (Doc. 2238), Constance Pentz (Doc. 2241), Paul \\n\\n8 Three of the submitted objections relate, at least in part, to the requested attorneys’ fees or service awards—those of \\nObjectors Helfand, Higgitt, and Pentz (Docs. 2238, 2241, 2242), and will be considered in connection the pending \\nMotion for an Award of Attorneys’ Fees, Costs and Expenses, and for Plaintiff Service Awards, Docs. 2230, 2231. \\n9 To the extent any of these filings are considered “objections” they are overruled. McDaniel believes that opting out \\nshould not be required, but that is an objection to a Federal Rule, not the Settlement. And both McDaniel and Zoccali \\nbelieve that class actions benefit lawyers too much, but offer no substantive complaint regarding the Settlement before \\nthe Court. \\n\\n13 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCase 1:19-cv-02939-AJT-JFA   Document 126   Filed 09/13/22   Page 14 of 25 PageID# 477\\n\\nHiggitt (Doc. 2242), and Daniel Komen (Doc. 2243). \\n\\nObjection  to  the  Adequacy  of  Representative  Plaintiffs  and  Class  Counsel.  Objector \\n\\nHelfand’s  claim is that there exists  a fundamental conflict of interest among three groups: “class \\n\\nmembers who have accrued damages, those still accruing damages, and those facing the prospect \\n\\nof future damage accrual.” This objection has been rejected by multiple courts in analogous cases, \\n\\nand is rejected here. See, e.g., In re Target Corp. Customer Data Sec. Breach Litig., 892 F.3d 968, \\n\\n974- 76 (8th Cir. 2018); Equifax, 2020 WL 256132, at *20-22; Anthem, 327 F.R.D. at 309-11; In \\n\\nre:  The  Home  Depot,  Inc.,  Customer  Data  Sec.  Breach  Litig.,  No.  1:14-md-02583,  2016  WL \\n\\n6902351, at *4 (N.D. Ga. 2016) (rejecting all objections, including objection that separate counsel \\n\\nwas necessary to represent allegedly conflicting subclasses) (Doc. 237 at 39-40 (objection); Doc. \\n\\n245 at 21-23 (reply in support of final approval)). \\n\\nHelfand’s reliance on Amchem, 521 U.S. 591 and Oritz v. Fibreboard Corp., 527 U.S. 815 \\n\\n(1999), is misplaced. Unlike in this case, Amchem and Ortiz were massive personal injury “class \\n\\naction[s] prompted by the elephantine mass of asbestos cases” that “defie[d] customary judicial \\n\\nadministration.” Prof’l Firefighters Ass’n of Omaha, Local 385 v. Zalewski, 678 F.3d 640, 646-48 \\n\\n(8th  Cir.  2012).  In  those  cases,  adequacy  was  not  sufficiently  protected  within  a  single  class \\n\\nbecause claimants who suffered diverse medical conditions as a result of asbestos exposure wanted \\n\\nto maximize the immediate payout, whereas healthy claimants had a strong countervailing interest \\n\\nin preserving funds in case they became ill in the future. These vast differences between groups of \\n\\nclaimants  required  “caution  [because]  individual  stakes  are  high  and  disparities  among  class \\n\\nmembers great.” 521 U.S. at 625. Those concerns are simply not present in this consumer case \\n\\nwhere all Settlement Class Members allege the same injury from the compromise of their personal \\n\\ninformation. See Equifax, 2020 WL 256132, at *21. \\n\\nMoreover, there is no conflict between the two groups Helfand identifies, as there was in \\n\\n14 \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cCase 1:19-cv-02939-AJT-JFA   Document 126   Filed 09/13/22   Page 15 of 25 PageID# 478\\n\\nAmchem, because of the nature of the harm caused by the Breach. Those who have already suffered \\n\\nlosses stand just as likely to continue to suffer future losses by the misuse of their information as \\n\\nthose who have not suffered any monetary losses to date. Thus, unlike in Amchem, everyone has \\n\\nan incentive to protect all Settlement Class Members against future harms. As the Eighth Circuit \\n\\nexplained  when  confronted  with  identical  objections  in  another  data  breach  settlement: \\n\\n“Accordingly, the interests of the two subclasses here are more congruent than disparate, and there \\n\\nis no fundamental conflict requiring separate representation.” Target, 892 F.3d at 976; see also \\n\\nAnthem, 327  F.R.D.  at 309. The Settlement  provides both compensation  for current  losses and \\n\\nprotection  against  future  losses,  including  identity  theft  insurance—all  of  which  benefit  all \\n\\nSettlement Class Members. Helfand’s objection is overruled. \\n\\nThe additional grounds on which the Objectors object are also overruled. Higgitt objects to \\n\\nthe value of the Settlement and the benefits conferred on the Class. For example, he claims that \\n\\nthe  $190  Million  Settlement  Fund  is  “absurdly  low,”  is  not  “a  sufficient  punishment  of  the \\n\\nCompanies for their negligent disregard for the safety of the customer data entrusted to their care,” \\n\\nand that three years Restoration Services and Identity Defense Services is a “wholly inadequate” \\n\\nperiod of time. Doc. 2242 at 1-2. \\n\\nHowever, “[i]n determining whether to approve a class action settlement, the issue is not \\n\\nwhether everyone affected by the settlement is completely satisfied. Instead, the test is whether the \\n\\nsettlement, as a whole, is a fair, adequate, and reasonable resolution of the class claims asserted.” \\n\\nSkochin v. Genworth Fin., Inc., 2020 WL 6532833, at *18 (E.D. Va. 2020). When a settlement \\n\\nresults  from  hard-fought  litigation  and  negotiation,  objections  regarding  the  amount  of  the \\n\\nsettlement  do  not  provide  a  justification  for  its  rejection  unless  the  amount  secured  is  unfair, \\n\\nunreasonable, or inadequate. Id. Objections that the settlement fund is too small for the class size, \\n\\nor that a defendant should be required to pay more to punish and deter future bad behavior, while \\n\\n15 \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cCase 1:19-cv-02939-AJT-JFA   Document 126   Filed 09/13/22   Page 16 of 25 PageID# 479\\n\\nunderstandable, do not take into account the risks and realities of litigation, and are not a basis for \\n\\nrejecting the settlement. Linney v. Cellular Alaska P’ship, 151 F.3d 1234, 1242 (9th Cir. 1998) \\n\\n(“[T]he very essence of a settlement is compromise, a yielding of absolutes and an abandoning of \\n\\nhighest hopes.”) (cleaned up). As argued above, and as this Court provisionally determined in its \\n\\nPreliminary  Approval  Order,  the  relief  provided  by  the  Settlement  is  “fair,  reasonable,  and \\n\\nadequate, in accordance with Rule 23(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.” Doc. 2220 at 2. \\n\\nThis objection is overruled. \\n\\nHiggitt also objects to the processes by which customers can interact with the Settlement \\n\\nAdministrator to gain information about the Settlement. Doc. 2242 at 2. These objections contain \\n\\nfactual errors. His first process-related objection is that: “No provision has been made for each \\n\\nmember of the Class to discover what exact private information was stolen during this breach.” Id. \\n\\nIn fact, those Settlement Class Members whose Social Security numbers or linked bank account \\n\\nnumbers were accessed during the Data Breach were specifically notified of that fact. Doc. 2219- \\n\\n6 at 23. With respect to the remainder of the data accessed in the Data Breach, which included \\n\\n“some combination of people’s names addresses, zip codes/postal codes, phone numbers, email \\n\\naddresses,  dates  of  birth,  self-reported  income,  credit  scores,  credit  limits,  balances,  payment \\n\\nhistory, contact data, and/or fragments of transaction data from a total of 23 days during 2016, \\n\\n2017 and 2018,” (Doc. 2242 at 2), it would be entirely impractical—if not impossible—to devise \\n\\na system that would convey to Settlement Class Members the specific combination of accessed \\n\\ndata for each of 98 million Settlement Class Members. Furthermore, Higgitt does not explain why \\n\\nthat level of detail would be helpful to him or to other Settlement Class Members who did not have \\n\\nthe most sensitive data (Social Security numbers and bank account numbers) accessed during the \\n\\nData Breach. Where “the essence of the objection is that, to be fair and reasonable, the Settlement \\n\\nAgreement must be tailored to each individual[s] circumstance,” the Skochin court overruled the \\n\\n16 \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cCase 1:19-cv-02939-AJT-JFA   Document 126   Filed 09/13/22   Page 17 of 25 PageID# 480\\n\\n“proposal [as] simply unworkable.” 2020 WL 6532833, at *22. The same principle applies here, \\n\\nand the objection is overruled. \\n\\nHiggitt  then objects that “it  is not possible  [to reach a human  being]  via  the Settlement \\n\\ntelephone  numbers  855-604-1811.”  Doc.  2242  at  2.  This  is  incorrect,  as  demonstrated  by  the \\n\\nSettlement Administrator’s declaration: \\n\\nThe  toll-free  telephone  number  was  prominently  displayed  in  all \\nNotice documents. During normal business hours, callers also have \\nthe option to speak to a live operator. The automated phone system \\nis  available 24 hours per  day,  7 days per  week. As of  August 24, \\n2022,  there  have  been  197,094  calls  to  the  toll-free  telephone \\nnumber  representing  901,481  minutes  of  use,  and  service  agents \\nhave handled 32,330 incoming calls representing 286,862 minutes \\nof use and 2,843 outbound calls representing 13,857 minutes of use. \\n\\nAzari Decl. ¶ 33. The Court overrules the factually incorrect objection that human agents were not \\n\\navailable at the toll-free number. \\n\\nFinally, objector Komen takes issue with the benefits conferred on the Class, although only \\n\\non behalf of the subset of Settlement Class Members who are also “members of the Equifax data \\n\\nbreach  settlement  class”  Doc.  2243  at  1.  He  argues  that  the  “three  years  of  Identity  Defense \\n\\nServices and Restoration Services proposed as compensation for the Capital One breach” has a \\n\\n“likely overlap” with the “four years of Experian’s credit monitoring services” offered in Equifax. \\n\\nId. He states that the services provided here “do not provide sufficient additional value to us, who \\n\\nhave had our sensitive information leaked twice.” (Id.) \\n\\nKomen’s objection does not present a valid objection to the value of the Settlement. He \\n\\nignores  the  monetary  relief  the  Settlement  provides,  which  includes  compensation  for  Out-of- \\n\\nPocket Losses and Lost Time up to $25,000. Doc. 2219-2 ¶¶ 3, 4, 6. And he ignores Capital One’s \\n\\nBusiness  Practice  commitments  relating  to  cybersecurity.  Finally,  there  is  no  impediment  to \\n\\nreceiving services under both settlements, which are provided by different companies and could \\n\\nprove useful to individuals who had their “sensitive information leaked twice.” As with Higgitt, \\n17 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCase 1:19-cv-02939-AJT-JFA   Document 126   Filed 09/13/22   Page 18 of 25 PageID# 481\\n\\nKomen  seeks  “the  Settlement  Agreement  [to  be]  tailored  to  each  individual  policyholder’s \\n\\ncircumstance,” here including other settlement benefits they may receive in other, unrelated cases. \\n\\nThis is “simply unworkable” in the class action context. Skochin, 2020 WL 6532833, at *22.10 The \\n\\nobjection is overruled. \\n\\n8. \\n\\nFindings  Concerning  the  Fairness,  Adequacy,  and  Reasonableness  of  the \\nSettlement. \\n\\nThe Court previously determined that the proposed Settlement meets the requirements of \\n\\nRule  23(e)  such  that  notice  should  issue.  Doc.  2220  ¶  2.  The  Court  now  determines  that  the \\n\\nSettlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate and should be approved in a class judgment. \\n\\nThe Court’s Rule 23(e) obligations are addressed with a “two-level analysis.” In re The \\n\\nMills, 265 F.R.D. at 254. To determine whether a settlement is fair, the Court considers the four \\n\\nfactors  set  forth  by  the  Fourth  Circuit  in  Jiffy  Lube:  “(1)  the  posture  of  the  case  at  the  time \\n\\nsettlement  was  proposed;  (2)  the  extent  of  discovery  that  had  been  conducted;  (3)  the \\n\\ncircumstances surrounding the negotiations; and (4) the experience of counsel.” In re Jiffy Lube \\n\\nSec. Litig., 927 F.2d 155, 159 (4th Cir. 1991). To determine whether a settlement is adequate, the \\n\\ncourts also look to: “(1) the relative strength of the plaintiffs’ case on the merits, (2) the existence \\n\\nof any difficulties of proof or strong defenses the plaintiffs are likely to encounter if the case goes \\n\\nto trial, (3) the anticipated duration and expense of additional litigation, (4) the solvency of the \\n\\ndefendants and the likelihood of recovery on a litigated judgment, and (5) the degree of opposition \\n\\n10 See also In re Yahoo! Inc. Customer Data Sec. Breach Litig., No. 16-MD-02752-LHK, 2020 WL  4212811,  at  *18 \\n(N.D.  Cal.  July  22,  2020),  appeal  dismissed,  No.  20-17438,  2021  WL \\n2451242 (9th Cir. Feb. 16, 2021), and aff’d, No. 20-16633, 2022 WL 2304236 (9th Cir. June  27, \\n2022) (“[T]he credit monitoring in the instant case is not entirely duplicative of the credit monitoring in Equifax. First, \\nthe  Equifax  settlement  contemplates  credit  monitoring  provided  by  different  credit  monitoring  services,  and  in  a \\ndifferent package, than the one provided by AllClear ID in the instant case. Credit monitoring by multiple, independent \\nentities still provides value to Settlement Class Members. Second, importantly, it is unclear whether the Equifax credit \\nmonitoring will ever overlap with the Credit Services provided by the instant Settlement in the first place because the \\nEquifax settlement is currently pending appeal before the Eleventh Circuit. It is therefore entirely possible that the two \\nyears’ worth of Credit Services offered in the instant case will expire before the Equifax credit monitoring becomes \\nactive. Third . . . it would be inequitable to retrospectively render this Settlement invalid based on the contents of a \\nsubsequent settlement reached in a different court in a different case.”). \\n\\n18 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCase 1:19-cv-02939-AJT-JFA   Document 126   Filed 09/13/22   Page 19 of 25 PageID# 482\\n\\nto the settlement.” Id. \\n\\nEvaluation  under  these  factors  confirms  that  the  Settlement  is  fair,  reasonable,  and \\n\\nadequate. The Court finds that this Settlement reflects an outstanding result for the Class in a case \\n\\nwith  a  significant  level  of  risk.  The  Settlement  provides  significant  monetary  benefits  to \\n\\ncompensate consumers for out-of-pocket losses and attested time spent dealing with issues related \\n\\nto the alleged data breach and important commitments by Capital One as to its future data security \\n\\npractices. This relief compares very favorably to settlements in other data breach class actions. The \\n\\nSettlement satisfies all requirements of Rule 23(e)(2). \\n\\na. \\n\\nThe Settlement Class Representatives and Plaintiffs’ Counsel Have \\nAdequately Represented the Class (Rule 23(e)(2)(A)). \\n\\nThe Court finds that the Settlement Class Representatives and Class Counsel have provided \\n\\nadequate representation to the Settlement Class by vigorously litigating this case in the face of \\n\\nstern opposition and denials of liability. Class Counsel negotiated a multi-faceted settlement that \\n\\nwas well received by the Class, as evidenced by the minimal objections. Class Counsel’s view that \\n\\nthe Settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate, and in the best interests of the Settlement Class, \\n\\nsupports approval of the Settlement. \\n\\nIn  addition,  the  Court  finds  the  Settlement  Class  Representatives  have  adequately \\n\\nrepresented the Settlement Class. Each of them provided documents, sworn interrogatories, and \\n\\nsat for their depositions—all of which was vital to Class Counsel’s investigation and litigation of \\n\\nthe class’s claims. Furthermore, each of them has remained active in the case, communicating with \\n\\nClass Counsel during subsequent phases of the case, and, in particular, reviewing and approving \\n\\nthe terms of the Settlement as being in the best interests of the Settlement Class. \\n\\nb. \\n\\nThe Settlement was Negotiated at Arm’s Length Class (Rule 23(e)(2)(B)). \\n\\nThe Court finds the Settlement was negotiated at arm’s length, without collusion, based on \\n\\nthe terms of the Settlement itself; the Parties’ vigorous pursuit of fact and expert discovery and \\n19 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCase 1:19-cv-02939-AJT-JFA   Document 126   Filed 09/13/22   Page 20 of 25 PageID# 483\\n\\nbriefing and argument of numerous legal issues; the length and difficulty of the negotiations; and \\n\\nthe  involvement  of  two  experienced  mediators,  including  Judge  Brinkema  across  several \\n\\nmediation sessions. \\n\\nc. \\n\\nThe Relief Provided for the Class is Adequate (Rule 23(e)(2)(C)) \\n\\nThe  relief  offered  to  Class  Members  in  the  proposed  Settlement  is  adequate  under  the \\n\\nfactors outlined in Rule 23(e)(2)(C). Settlement Class Members are entitled to benefits that are \\n\\ntailored  to  the  relief  sought  through  the  litigation:  recovery  of  up  to  $25,000  in  Out-of-Pocket \\n\\nLosses that the Class Member believes are fairly traceable to the Data Breach; payment for Lost \\n\\nTime spent dealing with the Data Breach; at least three years of Identity Defense Services to help \\n\\ndetect  and  remediate  potential  identity  theft  and  fraud;  and  at  least  three  years  of  Restoration \\n\\nServices  including  access  to  U.S.-based  specialists  in  fraud  resolution  and  identity  restoration \\n\\navailable to all Settlement Class Members without making a claim. Capital One’s agreed Business \\n\\nPractice Changes are likewise an important benefit flowing to Settlement Class Members, whose \\n\\nsensitive personal information may still reside at Capital One. \\n\\nClass  Counsel,  a  group  with  substantial  experience  in  leading  major  data  breach  class \\n\\nactions, strongly believe that the relief is fair, reasonable, and adequate. Doc. 2219-4 ¶¶ 3-10. The \\n\\nCourt  may  rely  upon  such  experienced  counsel’s  judgment,  which  is  further  confirmed  by \\n\\nconsidering the four specific factors enumerated in Rule 23(e)(2)(C). \\n\\nFactor 1: The Costs, Risk, And Delay Of Trial And Appeal. Plaintiffs faced significant \\n\\nrisks and costs should they continue to litigate the case. First, there was a risk that Plaintiffs’ claims \\n\\nwould not have survived, or survived in full, on a class-wide basis after a ruling on the fully briefed \\n\\nand argued motion  for  class certification,  motions  for summary judgment,  Daubert  motions on \\n\\ndamages  methodologies  and  other  issues,  and  challenges  to  the  existence  of  a  tort  duty  under \\n\\nVirginia law, among other motions. Second, if Plaintiffs had prevailed on their pending motion for \\n\\n20 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCase 1:19-cv-02939-AJT-JFA   Document 126   Filed 09/13/22   Page 21 of 25 PageID# 484\\n\\nclass certification and successfully defeated Defendants’ pending motions thus proceeding to trial, \\n\\nPlaintiffs still would have faced significant risk, cost, and delay including likely interlocutory and \\n\\npost-judgment appeals. \\n\\nIn contrast to the risk, cost, and delay posed by the pending motions and possible appeals \\n\\nand  trial,  the  proposed  Settlement  provides  certain,  substantial,  and  immediate  relief  to  the \\n\\nproposed Settlement Class. It ensures that Settlement Class Members with valid claims for Out- \\n\\nof-Pocket Losses or Lost Time will receive guaranteed compensation now and provides Settlement \\n\\nClass Members with access to Identity Defense Services and Restoration Services, benefits that \\n\\nmay not have been available at trial. It also requires injunctive relief that will help protect Class \\n\\nMember data from potential subsequent exposure. The substantial costs, risk, and delay of a trial \\n\\nand appeal support a finding that the proposed Settlement is adequate. \\n\\nFactor  2: The  Method  Of Distributing  Relief  Is Effective. The proposed distribution \\n\\nprocess will be efficient and effective. The available relief was detailed in the Notice, which lays \\n\\nout  clearly  the  benefits  to  which  Settlement  Class  Members  are  entitled,  including  benefits \\n\\nprovided regardless of whether a Settlement Class Member files a claim. The three categories of \\n\\nrelief will be distributed as follows: \\n\\nFirst, Settlement Class Members have made claims and may continue to make claims until \\n\\nSeptember 30, 2022, online via the Settlement website or by mail for reimbursement for Out-of- \\n\\nPocket Losses that the Settlement Class Members believe are fairly traceable to the Data Breach. \\n\\nSettlement Class Members need only submit a claim form on the website or by mail accompanied \\n\\nby reasonable documentation showing the claimed expenses to establish Out-of-Pocket Losses, or \\n\\na self-certification of their Lost Time. See Doc. 2219-2 ¶ 8. If a claim is rejected for any reason, \\n\\nthere is also a consumer-friendly appeals process whereby claimants will have the opportunity to \\n\\ncure  any  deficiencies  in  their  submission  or  request  an  automatic  appeal  if  the  Settlement \\n\\n21 \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cCase 1:19-cv-02939-AJT-JFA   Document 126   Filed 09/13/22   Page 22 of 25 PageID# 485\\n\\nAdministrator determines a claim is deficient in whole or part. Id. ¶ 9. \\n\\nSecond,  Settlement  Class  Members  will  be  entitled  to  at  least  three  years  of  Identity \\n\\nDefense Services provided by Pango. Settlement Class Members need only visit the Settlement \\n\\nwebsite and sign-up via an online form in order to claim this benefit. And even if a Settlement \\n\\nClass Member does not initially claim Identity Defense Services, they can later enroll directly with \\n\\nPango during the period of the service. \\n\\nThird,  for  at  least  three  years  all  Settlement  Class  Members  will  be  entitled  to  utilize \\n\\nRestoration Services offered through Pango, regardless of whether they submit a claim for losses \\n\\nor  enroll  in  Identity  Defense  Services.  This  coverage  is  a  separate  benefit  and  permits  all \\n\\nSettlement Class Members to have access to U.S.-based fraud resolution specialists who can assist \\n\\nwith  important  tasks  such  as  placing  fraud  alerts  with  the  credit  bureaus,  disputing  inaccurate \\n\\ninformation  on  credit  reports,  scheduling  calls  with  creditors  and  other  service  providers,  and \\n\\nworking with law enforcement and government agencies to dispute any fraudulent transactions or \\n\\ncredit applications. \\n\\nBecause Settlement Class Members may make claims through a simple online form or by \\n\\nmail—and have the benefit of additional services for which they need take no action, including the \\n\\nRestoration Services detailed above as well as the business practices Capital One has agreed to— \\n\\nthe method of distributing the relief is both efficient and effective, and the proposed Settlement is \\n\\nadequate under this factor. \\n\\nFactor 3: The Terms Relating To Attorneys’ Fees Are Reasonable. Class Counsel has \\n\\nrequested a fee from the $190 million common fund based on the widely accepted “percentage of \\n\\nthe  fund”  approach.  (Doc.  2231).  After  robust  notice  directed  at  the  approximately  98  million \\n\\nputative  class  members,  only  3  objections  relating  to  attorneys’  fees  are  before  the  Court,  as \\n\\ndiscussed  above.  Importantly,  the  Settlement  Agreement  is  not  conditioned  upon  the  Court’s \\n\\n22 \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cCase 1:19-cv-02939-AJT-JFA   Document 126   Filed 09/13/22   Page 23 of 25 PageID# 486\\n\\napproval of the fee award or the requested service awards. Doc. 2219-1, §§ 18.3, 19.3. This factor \\n\\nsupports approval of the Settlement. \\n\\nFactor 4: Any Agreement Required To Be Identified Under Rule 23(e)(3). The Parties \\n\\npreviously submitted to the Court, in camera, the specific terms of the provision allowing Capital \\n\\nOne  to  terminate  the  Settlement  if  more  than  a  certain  number  of  Class  Members  excluded \\n\\nthemselves from the Settlement Class. These provisions have not been triggered, and thus do not \\n\\naffect the adequacy of the relief obtained here. \\n\\nd. \\n\\nThe Settlement Treats Class Members Equitably Relative to Each Other \\n(Rule 23(e)(2)(D)). \\n\\nThe Settlement Class Members are treated equitably because they all have similar claims \\n\\narising from the same data breach, and they all are treated the same under the Settlement. Fed. R. \\n\\nCiv.  P.  23(e)(2)(D).  All  Settlement  Class  Members  are  eligible  to  claim  the  various  benefits \\n\\nprovided  by  the  Settlement  if  they  meet  the  requirements,  including  compensation  for  out-of- \\n\\npocket losses that they believe are fairly traceable to the Data Breach, compensation for time spent \\n\\nresponding to the Data Breach, and free Identity Defense Services. Moreover, all Settlement Class \\n\\nMembers—even those who do not submit claims—may access Restoration Services and benefit \\n\\nfrom Capital One’s Business Practice Commitments. \\n\\n9. \\n\\nFinal Approval.

This information included, without limitation, name, address, \\n\\nSocial  Security  number,  date  of  birth,  client  identification  number,  diagnostic  and  treatment \\n\\ninformation,  insurance  information,  claims  information,  and/or  images  associated  with  dental \\n\\ntreatment  (collectively,  “personally  identifiable  information”  or  “PII”).1  Defendant  failed  to \\n\\ncomply  with  industry standards  to  protect  information  systems  that  contained  Class  Members \\n\\nPII and PHI, and failed to provide timely, accurate, and adequate notice to Plaintiff and other Class \\n\\nMembers  that  their  PII and  PHI had  been accessed  and  copied  by  an  unauthorized  third \\n\\nparty. Plaintiff also alleges that Defendant failed to provide timely, accurate, and adequate notice \\n\\nto Plaintiff and Class Members of precisely what types of information was unencrypted and in the \\n\\npossession  of  unknown  third  parties. Plaintiff  seeks,  among  other  things,  orders  requiring \\n\\nDefendant  to  fully  and  accurately  disclose  the  nature  of  the  information  that  has  been \\n\\ncompromised, to adopt reasonably sufficient security practices and safeguards to prevent incidents \\n\\nlike  the  disclosure  in  the  future, to  destroy  information  no  longer  necessary  to  retain  for  the \\n\\npurposes  that  the information was  first  obtained  from  Class Members, and  to  provide a  sum  of \\n\\nmoney sufficient to provide to Plaintiff and Class Members identity theft protective services for \\n\\n1 Personally identifiable information generally incorporates information that can be used to distinguish or trace \\nan individual’s identity, either alone or when combined with other personal or identifying information. 2 C.F.R. § \\n200.79.  At  a  minimum,  it  includes  all  information  that  on  its  face  expressly  identifies  an  individual.  PII  also  is \\ngenerally defined to include certain identifiers that do not on their face name an individual, but that are considered to \\nbe particularly sensitive and/or valuable if in the wrong hands (for example, Social Security number, passport number, \\ndriver’s license number, financial account number). \\n\\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 3 \\n011073-11/1767047 V1 \\n\\n1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2000 • SEATTLE, WA 98101 \\n(206) 623-7292 • FAX (206) 623-0594 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0c1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n26 \\n\\n27 \\n\\n28 \\n\\ntheir respective lifetimes as Plaintiff and Class Members will be at an increased risk of identity \\n\\ntheft due to the conduct of Sea Mar described herein. \\n\\n2. \\n\\nSea Mar Community Health Centers is a private non-profit health care system with \\n\\nover  90  facilities  across  Washington.2  In  2020,  Sea  Mar  served  over  304,000  patients  and \\n\\nemployed over 2,700 individuals.3 According to public records, Sea Mar’s total assets at the end \\n\\nof 2020 exceeded $280 million and net assets exceeded $145 million.4  \\n\\n3. \\n\\nPlaintiff  and Class Members,  as patients of Defendant  and Defendant’s affiliated \\n\\nhealth  care  providers,  entrusted  Defendant  with  an  extensive  amount  of  their  PII  and \\n\\nPHI.  Defendant retained this information on its “digital environment”—even after the relationship \\n\\nended.  \\n\\n4. \\n\\nBy obtaining, collecting, using, and deriving a benefit from Plaintiff’s and Class \\n\\nMembers’  PII  and  PHI,  Defendant  assumed  legal  and  equitable  duties  to  Plaintiff  and  Class \\n\\nMembers. Defendant asserts that it understands the importance of protecting such information.  \\n\\n5. \\n\\nDefendant’s “Notice Privacy Practices” (“Privacy Policy”) is posted on its website. \\n\\nThe  Privacy  Policy  states:  “Sea  Mar  Community  Health  Centers  respects  your  privacy.  We \\n\\nunderstand  that  your  personal  health  information  is  very  sensitive.  We  will  not  disclose  your \\n\\ninformation to others unless you tell us to do so, or unless the law authorizes or requires us to do \\n\\nso.”5  \\n\\n6. \\n\\nThe  Privacy  Policy  states  that  Defendant  collects,  among  other  things,  personal \\n\\nhealth  information,  including  “symptoms,  test  results,  diagnoses,  treatment,  health  information \\n\\nfrom other providers, and billing and payment information relating to these services.”6  \\n\\n2 See http://www.seamar.org/ (last visited Nov. 22, 2021). \\n3 SEA MAR, 2020 Annual Report, at 8-10, available at https://www.seamar.org/seamar-downloads/Annual-\\n\\nReport2020.pdf (last visited Nov. 22, 2021).  \\n\\n4 See https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/display_990/911020139/04_2021_prefixes_87-\\n\\n91%2F911020139_202003_990_2021041217926132 (last visited Nov. 22, 2021). \\n\\n5 Ex. 1 (Notice of Privacy Practices), available at https://www.seamar.org/notice.html (last visited Nov. 22, \\n\\n2021). \\n\\n6 Id. \\n\\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 4 \\n011073-11/1767047 V1 \\n\\n1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2000 • SEATTLE, WA 98101 \\n(206) 623-7292 • FAX (206) 623-0594 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0c1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n7. \\n\\nFurther, under “Other Uses and Disclosures of Protected Health Information,” the \\n\\nPrivacy Policy states “[u]ses and disclosures not in this Notice will be made only as allowed or \\n\\nrequired by law or with your written authorization.”7 \\n\\n8. \\n\\nIn  addition,  Defendant’s  website  contains  a  form  contract  entitled  “Notice  of \\n\\nPrivacy  Practices  Acknowledgement”  (“Privacy  Acknowledgement”)  with  a  signature  line \\n\\nunderneath the words “I acknowledge receipt of Sea Mar Community Health Centers’ Notice of \\n\\nPrivacy Practices and Patient Rights and Responsibilities.”8 \\n\\n9. \\n\\nOn or about June 24, 2021, Defendant “was informed that certain Sea Mar data had \\n\\nbeen copied from its digital environment by an unauthorized actor.” Upon investigation, Defendant \\n\\n10 \\n\\nlearned  that  “additional  data  may  have  been  removed  from  its  digital  environment  between \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\nDecember 2020 and March 2021” (the “Data Breach”).9  \\n\\n10. \\n\\nAt the time of the Data Breach, the PII and PHI of Plaintiff and Class Members \\n\\n13 \\n\\nwere  accessible  from  the  internet,  despite  any  security  mechanisms  that  Defendant  wrongly \\n\\n14 \\n\\nbelieved would safeguard the PII and PHI from unauthorized access.  \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n11. \\n\\n12. \\n\\nAt the time of the Data Breach, none of the PII and PHI was encrypted.  \\n\\nAt the time of the Data Breach, the PII and PHI included information that Defendant \\n\\n17 \\n\\nno longer had a reasonable need to maintain. \\n\\n18 \\n\\n13. \\n\\nDespite  admitting  that  it  learned  of  the  Data  Breach  as  early  as  June  24,  2021, \\n\\n19 \\n\\nDefendant claims the process of collecting the contact information required to issue notification \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n26 \\n\\n27 \\n\\n28 \\n\\nletters to affected individuals was completed on August 30, 2021. \\n\\n14. \\n\\nOn  or  about  October  29,  2021,  at  least  four  months  after  it  learned  of  the  Data \\n\\nBreach, Defendant posted a Notice of Data Security Incident on its website.10 Only on or about \\n\\nthat date did Defendant begin notifying Plaintiff and Class Members of the Data Breach. \\n\\n7 Id. \\n8 Ex. 2 (Notice of Privacy Practices Acknowledgement), available at https://www.seamar.org/seamar-\\n\\ndownloads/covid/PatientAcknow_ENG.pdf (last visited Nov. 22, 2021).  \\n\\n9  See  Ex.  3  (Defendant’s  Notice  of  Data  Security  Incident),  available  at  https://www.seamar.org/seamar-\\n\\ndownloads/2021-10-28-Breach_Notice.pdf. \\n\\n10 Ex. 3 (Defendant’s Notice of Data Security Incident), available at https://www.seamar.org/seamar-\\n\\ndownloads/2021-10-28-Breach_Notice.pdf. \\n\\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 5 \\n011073-11/1767047 V1 \\n\\n1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2000 • SEATTLE, WA 98101 \\n(206) 623-7292 • FAX (206) 623-0594 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0c1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n15. \\n\\nOn or about October 30, 2021, Defendant reported to the Department of Health and \\n\\nHuman Services that the Data Breach compromised the unprotected health information of more \\n\\nthan 688,000 current or former Sea Mar patients.11 \\n\\n16. \\n\\nOn or about November 5, 2021, Defendant began notifying various states Attorneys \\n\\nGeneral of the Data Breach.12 \\n\\n17. \\n\\nFor  example,  on  or  about  November  5,  2021,  Defendant  notified  the  Maine \\n\\nAttorney General of the breach.13 According to the Maine Attorney General’s website, Defendant \\n\\nreported  that  the  breach  occurred  and/or  began  on  December  12,  2020  and  was  discovered  on \\n\\nAugust 30, 2021. Defendant reported to the Maine Attorney General that the breach affected a \\n\\n10 \\n\\ntotal of 651,500 individuals. \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n18. \\n\\nDefendant, in its Notice of Data Incident and its sample Breach Notification Letters, \\n\\nstated that it was not aware of any evidence of the misuse of information stolen in the incident.14 \\n\\n13 \\n\\nHowever, news reports indicate this information Defendant allowed to be compromised already \\n\\n14 \\n\\nhas found its way to the Dark Web, where it may be bought, sold and transferred in perpetuity, \\n\\n15 \\n\\ncausing victims of the Data Breach untold harm.

Since  at  least  last  December,  hackers  and  cybercriminals  have  had  access  to  the \\n\\n15 \\n\\nunencrypted, unredacted PII and PHI of more than 688,000 individuals, and since at least June of \\n\\n16 \\n\\n2021, that PII and PHI has been available for purchase on the Dark Web.  \\n\\n17 \\n\\n23. \\n\\nPlaintiff  and  Class  Members  face  a  lifetime  risk  of  identity  theft,  which  is \\n\\n18 \\n\\nheightened here by the loss of Social Security numbers. Plaintiff and Class Members are currently \\n\\n19 \\n\\nsuffering and for the rest of their lifetimes will suffer the significant and concrete risk that their \\n\\n20 \\n\\nidentities  will  be  (or  already  have  been)  misused—a  virtual  certainty  given  that  Plaintiff’s  and \\n\\n21 \\n\\nClass Members’ PII and/or PHI were being sold on the Dark Web long before Defendant notified \\n\\n22 \\n\\nPlaintiff and Class Members of the Data Breach. \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24. \\n\\nThis PII and PHI was compromised, exfiltrated, and offered for sale on the Dark \\n\\n24 \\n\\nWeb due to Defendant’s negligent and/or careless acts and omissions and the failure to protect the \\n\\n25 \\n\\nPII and PHI of Plaintiff and Class Members.  \\n\\n26 \\n\\n27 \\n\\n28 \\n\\n16 Id. \\n17 See id. \\n\\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 7 \\n011073-11/1767047 V1 \\n\\n1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2000 • SEATTLE, WA 98101 \\n(206) 623-7292 • FAX (206) 623-0594 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0c1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n25. \\n\\nPlaintiff brings this action on behalf of all persons whose PII and PHI was accessed, \\n\\nacquired, and/or misappropriated as a result of Defendant’s failure to: (i) adequately protect the \\n\\nPII  and  PHI  of  Plaintiff  and  Class  Members;  (ii)  warn  Plaintiff  and  Class  Members  of  its \\n\\ninadequate information security practices; and (iii) avoid sharing the PII and PHI of Plaintiff and \\n\\nClass  Members  without  adequate  safeguards.

The  Social  Security  Administration  stresses  that  the  loss  of  an \\n\\nindividual’s Social Security number, as is the case here, can lead to identity theft and extensive \\n\\nfinancial fraud: \\n\\nA dishonest person who has your Social Security number can use it \\nto get other personal information about you. Identity thieves can use \\nyour number and your good credit to apply for more credit in your \\nname.  Then,  they  use  the  credit  cards  and  don’t  pay  the  bills,  it \\ndamages your credit. You may not find out that someone is using \\nyour number until you’re turned down for credit, or you begin to get \\ncalls  from  unknown  creditors  demanding  payment  for  items  you \\nnever bought. Someone illegally using your Social Security number \\nand assuming your identity can cause a lot of problems.58 \\n\\n80.  What is more, it is no easy task to change or cancel a stolen Social Security number. \\n\\nAn  individual  cannot  obtain  a  new  Social  Security  number  without  significant  paperwork  and \\n\\nevidence of actual misuse. In other words, preventive action to defend against the possibility of \\n\\nmisuse of a Social Security number is not permitted; an individual must show evidence of actual, \\n\\nongoing fraud activity to obtain a new number. \\n\\n81. \\n\\nEven then, a new Social Security number may not be effective. According to Julie \\n\\nFerguson of the Identity Theft Resource Center, “[t]he credit bureaus and banks are able to link \\n\\nthe  new  number  very  quickly  to  the  old  number,  so  all  of  that  old  bad  information  is  quickly \\n\\ninherited into the new Social Security number.”59 \\n\\n56  Here’s  How  Much  Your  Personal  Information  Is  Selling  for  on  the  Dark  Web,  Experian,  Dec.  6,  2017, \\navailable at: https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/heres-how-much-your-personal-information-is-selling-\\nfor-on-the-dark-web/  (last accessed Apr. 5, 2021). \\n\\n57 In the Dark, VPNOverview, 2019, available at: https://vpnoverview.com/privacy/anonymous-browsing/in-\\n\\nthe-dark/ (last accessed Apr. 5, 2021). \\n\\n58  SOCIAL  SECURITY  ADMINISTRATION,  Identity  Theft  and  Your  Social  Security  Number,  available  at: \\n\\nhttps://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10064.pdf (last accessed Apr. 5, 2021). \\n\\n59 Bryan Naylor, Victims of Social Security Number Theft Find It’s Hard to Bounce Back, NPR (Feb. 9, 2015), \\navailable  at:  http://www.npr.org/2015/02/09/384875839/data-stolen-by-anthem-s-hackers-has-millionsworrying-\\nabout-identity-theft (last accessed Apr. 5, 2021). \\n\\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 22 \\n011073-11/1767047 V1 \\n\\n1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2000 • SEATTLE, WA 98101 \\n(206) 623-7292 • FAX (206) 623-0594 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0c1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n82. \\n\\nFurther, there is a market for Plaintiff’s and Class Members PHI, and the stolen PII \\n\\nand  PHI  has  inherent  value.  Sensitive  healthcare  data  can  sell  for  as  much  as  $363  per  record \\n\\naccording to the Infosec Institute.60 \\n\\n83. \\n\\nPHI  is  particularly  valuable  because  criminals  can  use  it  to  target  victims  with \\n\\nfrauds and scams that take advantage of the victim’s medical conditions or victim settlements. It \\n\\ncan  be  used  to  create  fake  insurance  claims,  allowing  for  the  purchase  and  resale  of  medical \\n\\nequipment, or gain access to prescriptions for illegal use or resale. Drug manufacturers, medical \\n\\ndevice manufacturers, pharmacies, hospitals, and other healthcare service providers often purchase \\n\\nPII and PHI on the black market for the purpose of target marketing their products and services to \\n\\n10 \\n\\nthe physical maladies of the data breach victims themselves. Insurance companies purchase and \\n\\n11 \\n\\nuse wrongfully disclosed PHI to adjust their insureds’ medical insurance premiums. \\n\\n12 \\n\\n84.  Medical identify theft can result in inaccuracies in medical records and costly false \\n\\n13 \\n\\nclaims. It can also have life-threatening consequences. If a victim’s health information is mixed \\n\\n14 \\n\\nwith other records, it can lead to misdiagnosis or mistreatment. “Medical identity theft is a growing \\n\\n15 \\n\\nand dangerous crime that leaves its victims with little to no recourse for recovery,” reported Pam \\n\\n16 \\n\\nDixon,  executive  director  of  World  Privacy  Forum.  “Victims  often  experience  financial \\n\\n17 \\n\\nrepercussions and worse yet, they frequently discover erroneous information has been added to \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n26 \\n\\n27 \\n\\n28 \\n\\ntheir personal medical files due to the thief’s activities.”61 \\n\\n85. \\n\\nSimilarly, the FBI Cyber Division, in an April 8, 2014 Private Industry Notification, \\n\\nadvised: \\n\\nCyber criminals are selling [medical] information on the black market at a rate of \\n$50 for each partial EHR, compared to $1 for a stolen social security number or \\ncredit  card  number.

The information \\n\\ncompromised  in  this  Data  Breach  is  impossible  to  “close”  and  difficult,  if  not  impossible,  to \\n\\nchange—name, Social Security number, medical records, and potentially date of birth. \\n\\n87. \\n\\nThis data demands a much higher price on the black market. Martin Walter, senior \\n\\ndirector  at  cybersecurity  firm  RedSeal,  explained,  “[c]ompared  to  credit  card  information, \\n\\npersonally identifiable information and Social Security numbers are worth more than 10x on the \\n\\nblack market.”63 \\n\\n88. \\n\\nAmong  other  forms  of  fraud,  identity  thieves  may  obtain  driver’s  licenses, \\n\\ngovernment benefits, medical services, and housing or even give false information to police. \\n\\n89. \\n\\nThe PII of Plaintiff and Class Members was taken by hackers to engage in identity \\n\\ntheft or and or to sell it to other criminals who will purchase the PII for that purpose. The fraudulent \\n\\nactivity resulting from the Data Breach may not come to light for years. \\n\\n90. \\n\\nThere may be a time lag between when harm occurs versus when it is discovered, \\n\\nand  also  between  when  PII  is  stolen  and  when  it  is  used.  According  to  the  U.S.  Government \\n\\nAccountability Office (“GAO”), which conducted a study regarding data breaches: \\n\\n[L]aw enforcement officials told us that in some cases, stolen data \\nmay be held for up to a year or more before being used to commit \\nidentity theft. Further, once stolen data have been sold or posted on \\nthe Web, fraudulent use of that information may continue for years. \\nAs a result, studies that attempt to measure the harm resulting from \\ndata breaches cannot necessarily rule out all future harm.64 \\n\\nI. \\n\\nDefendant’s Conduct Violates HIPAA \\n\\n91. \\n\\nTitle II of HIPAA contains what are known as the Administrative Simplification \\n\\nprovisions.  42  U.S.C.  §§  1301,  et  seq.

The  FTC  further  recommends  that  companies  not  maintain  PII  longer  than  is \\n\\nneeded for authorization of a transaction; limit access to private data; require complex passwords \\n\\nto be used on networks; use industry-tested methods for security; monitor for suspicious activity \\n\\non the network; and verify that third-party service providers have implemented reasonable security \\n\\nmeasures.68 \\n\\n101.  The  FTC  has  brought  enforcement  actions  against  businesses  for  failing  to \\n\\nadequately and reasonably protect customer data, treating the failure to employ reasonable and \\n\\nappropriate measures to protect against unauthorized access to confidential consumer data as an \\n\\nunfair act or practice prohibited by Section 5 of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. § 45. Orders resulting \\n\\nfrom these actions further clarify the measures businesses must take to meet their data security \\n\\nobligations. \\n\\n102.  Defendant failed to properly implement basic data security practices. Defendant’s \\n\\nfailure to employ reasonable and appropriate measures to protect against unauthorized access to \\n\\npatients’ Private Information constitutes an unfair act or practice prohibited by Section 5 of the \\n\\nFTC Act, 15 U.S.C. § 45. \\n\\n103.  Defendant was at all times fully aware of its obligation to protect the PII of patients \\n\\nbecause of its position as a leading healthcare provider.

At all relevant times, Defendant knew, or reasonably should have known, of the \\n\\nimportance  of  safeguarding  the  PII  of  Plaintiff  and  Class  Members,  including  Social  Security \\n\\nnumbers and/or dates of birth, and of the foreseeable consequences that would occur if the PII was \\n\\ncompromised, including, specifically, the significant costs that would be imposed on Plaintiff and \\n\\nClass Members as a result. \\n\\n105.  Plaintiff  and  Class  Members  now  face  years  of  constant  surveillance  of  their \\n\\nfinancial and  personal  records, monitoring,  and loss of rights. Plaintiff  and Class  Members are \\n\\nincurring and will continue to incur such damages in addition to any fraudulent use of their PII. \\n\\n10 \\n\\n106.  Defendant  was,  or  should  have  been,  fully  aware  of  the  unique  type  and  the \\n\\n11 \\n\\nsignificant volume of data stored on and/or shared on its system, amounting to more than 656,000 \\n\\n12 \\n\\nindividuals’ detailed, personal information and, thus, the significant number of individuals who \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n26 \\n\\n27 \\n\\n28 \\n\\nwould be harmed by the exposure of the unencrypted data. \\n\\n107.  To date, Defendant has offered Plaintiff and Class Members whose Social Security \\n\\nnumbers were released only one year of identity monitoring services through a single provider, \\n\\nKroll. Enrollment in the service is only available until January 27, 2021. The offered service is \\n\\ninadequate to protect Plaintiff and Class Members from the threats they face for years to come, \\n\\nparticularly in light of the PII at issue here. \\n\\n108.  The injuries to Plaintiff and Class Members were directly and proximately caused \\n\\nby Defendant’s failure to implement or maintain adequate data security measures for the PII of \\n\\nPlaintiff and Class Members. \\n\\nL. \\n\\nPlaintiff Jeffrie Alan Summers II’s Experience \\n\\n109.  Two  and  a  half  years  ago,  Plaintiff  sought  dental  care  at  one  of  Defendant’s \\n\\nfacilities. As a condition of that care, Plaintiff was required to provide his personal and medical \\n\\ninformation, including his Social Security number. \\n\\n110.  Plaintiff last visited one of Defendant’s facilities approximately one year ago. \\n\\n111.

As a result of the Data Breach, Plaintiff spent time dealing with the consequences \\n\\nof the Data Breach, which includes time spent on the telephone and sorting through his unsolicited \\n\\nemails, verifying the legitimacy of the Data Breach, exploring credit monitoring and identity theft \\n\\ninsurance  options,  attempting  to  enroll  in  the  credit  monitoring  and  identity  theft  protection \\n\\nservices offered by Defendant, and self-monitoring his accounts. This time has been lost forever \\n\\nand cannot be recaptured. \\n\\n113.  Additionally, Plaintiff is very careful about sharing his PII. He has never knowingly \\n\\ntransmitted unencrypted PII over the internet or any other unsecured source. \\n\\n114.  Plaintiff  stores  any  documents  containing  his  PII  in  a  safe  and  secure  location. \\n\\nMoreover, he diligently chooses unique usernames and passwords for his few online accounts. \\n\\n115.  Plaintiff  suffered  actual  injury  in  the  form  of  damages  to  and  diminution  in  the \\n\\nvalue of his PII—a form of intangible property that Plaintiff entrusted to Defendant for the purpose \\n\\nof obtaining healthcare from Defendant, which was compromised in and as a result of the Data \\n\\n14 \\n\\nBreach. \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n116.  Plaintiff suffered lost time, annoyance, interference, and inconvenience as a result \\n\\nof the Data Breach and has anxiety and increased concerns for the loss of his privacy.  \\n\\n117.  Plaintiff has suffered injury arising from the present and continuing risk of fraud, \\n\\n18 \\n\\nidentity theft, and misuse resulting from his PII and PHI, especially his Social Security number, in \\n\\n19 \\n\\ncombination with his name, being placed in the hands of unauthorized third parties and possibly \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\ncriminals. \\n\\n118.

Excluded from the Class and subclass are the following individuals and/or entities: \\n\\nDefendant and Defendant’s parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers and directors, and any entity \\n\\nin which Defendant has a controlling interest; all individuals who make a timely election to be \\n\\nexcluded from this proceeding using the correct protocol for opting out; any and all federal, state \\n\\nor local governments, including, but not limited to, their departments, agencies, divisions, bureaus, \\n\\nboards, sections, groups, counsels and/or subdivisions; and all judges assigned to hear any aspect \\n\\nof this litigation, as well as their immediate family members and staff members. \\n\\n123.  Plaintiff reserves the right to modify or amend the definition of the proposed Class \\n\\nand subclass before the Court determines whether certification is appropriate. \\n\\n124.  This action is brought and may be maintained as a class action because there is a \\n\\nwell-defined community of interest among many persons who comprise a readily ascertainable \\n\\nclass. A well-defined community of interest exists to warrant class-wide relief because Plaintiff \\n\\nand  all  members  of  the  Nationwide  Class  were  subjected  to  the  same  wrongful  practices  by \\n\\nDefendant, entitling them to the same relief. \\n\\n125.  The  Nationwide  Class  is  so  numerous  that  individual  joinder  of  its  members  is \\n\\nimpracticable.  While  the  exact  number  of  Class  Members  is  unknown  to  Plaintiff  at  this  time, \\n\\nPlaintiff is informed and believes that there are at least hundreds of thousands of Class Members. \\n\\nDefendant advised the Department of Health and Human Services that the breach affected at least \\n\\n688,000 individuals. \\n\\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 30 \\n011073-11/1767047 V1 \\n\\n1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2000 • SEATTLE, WA 98101 \\n(206) 623-7292 • FAX (206) 623-0594 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0c1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n26 \\n\\n27 \\n\\n28 \\n\\n126.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to members of the Nationwide Class \\n\\nand predominate over any questions which affect only individual members of the Class. These \\n\\ncommon questions include, but are not limited to: \\n\\na. \\n\\nb. \\n\\nc. \\n\\nd. \\n\\ne. \\n\\nf. \\n\\ng. \\n\\nh. \\n\\ni. \\n\\nj. \\n\\nk. \\n\\nl. \\n\\nWhether and to what extent Defendant had a duty to protect the PII and PHI \\nof Plaintiff and Class Members; \\n\\nWhether Defendant had a duty not to disclose the PII and PHI of Plaintiff \\nand Class Members to unauthorized third parties; \\n\\nWhether Defendant had a duty not to use the PII and PHI of Plaintiff and \\nClass Members for non-business purposes; \\n\\nWhether  Defendant  failed  to  adequately  safeguard  the  PII  and  PHI  of \\nPlaintiff and Class Members; \\n\\nWhether and when Defendant actually learned of the Data Breach; \\n\\nWhether Defendant adequately, promptly, and accurately informed Plaintiff \\nand Class Members that their PII and PHI had been compromised; \\n\\nWhether Defendant violated the law by failing to promptly notify Plaintiff \\nand Class Members that their PII and PHI had been compromised; \\n\\nWhether Defendant failed to implement and maintain reasonable security \\nprocedures  and  practices  appropriate  to  the  nature  and  scope  of  the \\ninformation compromised in the Data Breach; \\n\\nWhether  Defendant  adequately  addressed  and  fixed  the  vulnerabilities \\nwhich permitted the Data Breach to occur; \\n\\nWhether Defendant engaged in unfair, unlawful, or deceptive practices by \\nfailing to safeguard the PII and PHI of Plaintiff and Class Members; \\n\\nWhether Plaintiff and Class Members are entitled to actual, damages, and/or \\nstatutory damages as a result of Defendant’s wrongful conduct; \\n\\nWhether Plaintiff and Class Members are entitled to restitution as a result \\nof Defendant’s wrongful conduct; and \\n\\nm.  Whether  Plaintiff  and  Class  Members  are  entitled  to  injunctive  relief  to \\nredress the imminent and currently ongoing harm faced as a result of the \\nData Breach. \\n\\n127.  Plaintiff is a member of the Class and alternative subclass he seeks to represent and \\n\\nhis  claims  and  injuries  are  typical  of  the  claims  and  injuries  of  the  other  Class  and  subclass \\n\\nmembers. \\n\\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 31 \\n011073-11/1767047 V1 \\n\\n1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2000 • SEATTLE, WA 98101 \\n(206) 623-7292 • FAX (206) 623-0594 \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0c1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n128.  Plaintiff will adequately and fairly protect the interests of other Class Members.  \\n\\nPlaintiff has no interests adverse to the interests of absent Class Members. Plaintiff is represented \\n\\nby  legal  counsel  with  substantial  experience  in  class  action  litigation.  The  interests  of  Class \\n\\nMembers will be fairly and adequately protected by Plaintiff and his counsel. \\n\\n129.  Defendant has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the Class \\n\\nMembers,  so  that  final  injunctive  relief  or  corresponding  declaratory  relief  is  appropriate \\n\\nrespecting the Class as a whole. \\n\\n130.  A class action is superior to other available means for fair and efficient adjudication \\n\\nof  the  claims  of  the  Class  and  would  be  beneficial  for  the  parties  and  the  Court.  Class  action \\n\\n10 \\n\\ntreatment will allow a large number of similarly situated persons to prosecute their common claims \\n\\n11 \\n\\nin a single forum, simultaneously, efficiently, and without the unnecessary duplication of effort \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n26 \\n\\n27 \\n\\n28 \\n\\nand  expense  that  numerous  individual  actions  would  require.    The  amounts  owed  to  the  many \\n\\nindividual  Class  Members  are  likely  to  be  relatively  small,  and  the  burden  and  expense  of \\n\\nindividual litigation would make it difficult or impossible for individual members of the Class to \\n\\nseek and obtain relief. A class action will serve an important public interest by permitting such \\n\\nindividuals  to  effectively  pursue  recovery  of  the  sums  owed  to  them.    Further,  class  litigation \\n\\nprevents the potential for inconsistent or contradictory judgments raised by individual litigation. \\n\\nPlaintiff is unaware of any difficulties that are likely to be encountered in the management of this \\n\\naction that would preclude its maintenance as a class action. \\n\\nCOUNT I \\n\\nNEGLIGENCE \\n(ON BEHALF OF PLAINTIFF AND THE NATIONWIDE CLASS) \\n\\n131.  Plaintiff and the Nationwide Class re-allege and incorporate by reference herein all \\n\\nof the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 130. \\n\\n132.  Plaintiff and the Nationwide Class provided and entrusted Defendant with certain \\n\\nPII and PHI, including, without limitation, name, address, Social Security number, date of birth, \\n\\nclient \\n\\nidentification  number,  medical/vision/dental/orthodontic  diagnostic  and \\n\\ntreatment \\n\\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 32 \\n011073-11/1767047 V1 \\n\\n1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2000 • SEATTLE, WA 98101 \\n(206) 623-7292 • FAX (206) 623-0594 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0c1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\ninformation,  medical/vision/dental  insurance  information,  claims  information,  and/or  images \\n\\nassociated with dental treatment. \\n\\n133.  Plaintiff and the Nationwide Class entrusted their PII and PHI to Defendant on the \\n\\npremise and with the understanding that Defendant would safeguard their information, use their \\n\\nPII and PHI for business purposes only, and/or not disclose their PII and PHI to unauthorized third \\n\\nparties.  \\n\\n134.  Defendant has full knowledge of the sensitivity of the PII and PHI and the types of \\n\\nharm  that  Plaintiff  and  the  Nationwide  Class  could  and  would  suffer  if  the  PII  and  PHI  were \\n\\nwrongfully disclosed. \\n\\n10 \\n\\n135.  Defendant knew or reasonably should have known that the failure to exercise due \\n\\n11 \\n\\ncare in the collecting, storing, and using of the PII and PHI of Plaintiff and the Nationwide Class \\n\\n12 \\n\\ninvolved  an  unreasonable  risk  of  harm  to  Plaintiff and  the Nationwide  Class,  even  if  the  harm \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\noccurred through the criminal acts of a third party. \\n\\n136.  Defendant  had  a  duty  to  exercise  reasonable  care  in  safeguarding,  securing,  and \\n\\n15 \\n\\nprotecting such information from being compromised, lost, stolen, misused, and/or disclosed to \\n\\n16 \\n\\nunauthorized parties. This duty includes, among other things, designing, maintaining, and testing \\n\\n17 \\n\\nDefendant’s security protocols to ensure that the PII and PHI of Plaintiff and the Nationwide Class \\n\\n18 \\n\\nin Defendant’s possession was adequately secured and protected. \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n137.  Defendant also had a duty to exercise appropriate clearinghouse practices to remove \\n\\nPII and PHI it was no longer required to retain pursuant to regulations, including that of former \\n\\ncustomers or patients. \\n\\n138.  Defendant also had a duty to have procedures in place to detect and prevent the \\n\\nimproper access and misuse of the PII and PHI of Plaintiff and the Nationwide Class. \\n\\n139.  Defendant’s duty to use reasonable security measures arose as a result of the special \\n\\nrelationship that existed between Defendant and Plaintiff and the Nationwide Class.  That special \\n\\n26 \\n\\nrelationship  arose  because  Plaintiff  and  the  Nationwide  Class  entrusted  Defendant  with  their \\n\\n27 \\n\\nconfidential PII and PHI, a necessary part of their relationships with Defendant. \\n\\n28 \\n\\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 33 \\n011073-11/1767047 V1 \\n\\n1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2000 • SEATTLE, WA 98101 \\n(206) 623-7292 • FAX (206) 623-0594 \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0c1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n140.  Defendant  was  subject  to  an  “independent  duty,”  untethered  to  any  contract \\n\\nbetween Defendant and Plaintiff or the Nationwide Class. \\n\\n141.  A breach of security, unauthorized access, and resulting injury to Plaintiff and the \\n\\nNationwide  Class  was  reasonably  foreseeable,  particularly  in  light  of  Defendant’s  inadequate \\n\\nsecurity practices. \\n\\n142.  Plaintiff and the Nationwide Class were the foreseeable and probable victims of \\n\\nany inadequate security practices and procedures. Defendant knew or should have known of the \\n\\ninherent risks in collecting and storing the PII and PHI of Plaintiff and the Nationwide Class, the \\n\\ncritical  importance  of  providing  adequate  security  of  that  PII  and  PHI,  and  the  necessity  for \\n\\nencrypting PII and PHI stored on Defendant’s systems. \\n\\n143.  Defendant’s  own  conduct  created a  foreseeable  risk  of  harm  to  Plaintiff and  the \\n\\nNationwide Class. Defendant’s misconduct included, but was not limited to, its failure to take the \\n\\nsteps and opportunities to prevent the Data Breach as set forth herein. Defendant’s misconduct \\n\\nalso included its decisions not to comply with industry standards for the safekeeping of the PII and \\n\\nPHI of Plaintiff and the Nationwide Class, including basic encryption techniques freely available \\n\\n16 \\n\\nto Defendant. \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n144.  Plaintiff and the Nationwide Class had no ability to protect their PII and PHI that \\n\\nwas in, and possibly remains in, Defendant’s possession. \\n\\n145.  Defendant was in a position to protect against the harm suffered by Plaintiff and \\n\\nthe Nationwide Class as a result of the Data Breach. \\n\\n146.  Defendant had and continues to have a duty to adequately disclose that the PII and \\n\\nPHI  of  Plaintiff  and  the  Nationwide  Class  within  Defendant’s  possession  might  have  been \\n\\ncompromised, how it was compromised, and precisely the types of data that were compromised \\n\\nand when. Such notice was necessary to allow Plaintiff and the Nationwide Class to take steps to \\n\\nprevent, mitigate, and repair any identity theft and the fraudulent use of their PII and PHI by third \\n\\n26 \\n\\nparties. \\n\\n27 \\n\\n147.  Defendant  had  a  duty  to  employ  proper  procedures  to  prevent  the  unauthorized \\n\\n28 \\n\\ndissemination of the PII and PHI of Plaintiff and the Nationwide Class.  \\n\\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 34 \\n011073-11/1767047 V1 \\n\\n1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2000 • SEATTLE, WA 98101 \\n(206) 623-7292 • FAX (206) 623-0594 \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0c1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n26 \\n\\n27 \\n\\n28 \\n\\n148.  Defendant has admitted that the PII and PHI of Plaintiff and the Nationwide Class \\n\\nwas wrongfully lost and disclosed to unauthorized third persons as a result of the Data Breach. \\n\\n149.  Defendant, through its actions and/or omissions, unlawfully breached its duties to \\n\\nPlaintiff  and  the  Nationwide  Class  by  failing  to  implement  industry  protocols  and  exercise \\n\\nreasonable care in protecting and safeguarding the PII and PHI of Plaintiff and the Nationwide \\n\\nClass during the time the PII and PHI was within Defendant’s possession or control. \\n\\n150.  Defendant improperly and inadequately safeguarded the PII and PHI of Plaintiff \\n\\nand the Nationwide Class in deviation of standard industry rules, regulations, and practices at the \\n\\ntime of the Data Breach. \\n\\n151.  Defendant  failed  to  heed  industry  warnings  and  alerts  to  provide  adequate \\n\\nsafeguards to protect the PII and PHI of Plaintiff and the Nationwide Class in the face of increased \\n\\nrisk of theft.  \\n\\n152.  Defendant, through its actions and/or omissions, unlawfully breached its duty to \\n\\nPlaintiff and the Nationwide Class by failing to have appropriate procedures in place to detect and \\n\\nprevent dissemination of their PII and PHI. \\n\\n153.  Defendant  breached  its  duty  to  exercise  appropriate  clearinghouse  practices  by \\n\\nfailing to remove PII and PHI it was no longer required to retain pursuant to regulations. \\n\\n154.  Defendant, through its actions and/or omissions, unlawfully breached its duty to \\n\\nadequately and timely disclose to Plaintiff and the Nationwide Class the existence and scope of \\n\\nthe Data Breach. \\n\\n155.  But for Defendant’s wrongful and negligent breach of duties owed to Plaintiff and \\n\\nthe Nationwide Class, the PII and PHI of Plaintiff and the Nationwide Class would not have been \\n\\ncompromised. \\n\\n156.  There  is  a  close  causal  connection  between  Defendant’s  failure  to  implement \\n\\nsecurity measures to protect the PII and PHI of Plaintiff and the Nationwide Class and the harm, \\n\\nor  risk  of  imminent  harm,  suffered  by  Plaintiff  and  the  Nationwide  Class.  The  PII  and  PHI  of \\n\\nPlaintiff and the Nationwide Class was compromised as the proximate result of Defendant’s failure \\n\\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 35 \\n011073-11/1767047 V1 \\n\\n1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2000 • SEATTLE, WA 98101 \\n(206) 623-7292 • FAX (206) 623-0594 \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0c1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\nto  exercise  reasonable  care  in  safeguarding  such  PII  and  PHI  by  adopting,  implementing,  and \\n\\nmaintaining appropriate security measures. \\n\\n157.  Additionally, Section 5 of the FTC Act prohibits “unfair . . . practices in or affecting \\n\\ncommerce,”  including,  as  interpreted  and  enforced  by  the  FTC,  the  unfair  act  or  practice  by \\n\\nbusinesses, such as Defendant, of failing to use reasonable measures to protect PII and PHI. The \\n\\nFTC publications and orders described above also form part of the basis of Defendant’s duty in \\n\\nthis regard. \\n\\n158.  Defendant violated Section 5 of the FTC Act by failing to use reasonable measures \\n\\nto protect PII and PHI and not complying with applicable industry standards, as described in detail \\n\\n10 \\n\\nherein. Defendant’s conduct was particularly unreasonable given the nature and amount of PII and \\n\\n11 \\n\\nPHI it obtained and stored and the foreseeable consequences of the immense damages that would \\n\\n12 \\n\\nresult to Plaintiff and the Nationwide Class. \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n159.  Defendant’s violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act constitutes negligence per se. \\n\\n160.  Plaintiff and the Nationwide Class are within the class of persons that the FTC Act \\n\\n15 \\n\\nwas intended to protect. \\n\\n16 \\n\\n161.  The harm that occurred as a result of the Data Breach is the type of harm the FTC \\n\\n17 \\n\\nAct was intended to guard against. The FTC has pursued enforcement actions against businesses, \\n\\n18 \\n\\nwhich, as a result of their failure to employ reasonable data security measures and avoid unfair and \\n\\n19 \\n\\ndeceptive practices, caused the same harm as that suffered by Plaintiff and the Nationwide Class.   \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n162.  Defendant’s violation of HIPAA also independently constitutes negligence per se. \\n\\n163.  HIPAA  privacy  laws  were  enacted  with  the  objective  of  protecting  the \\n\\nconfidentiality of patients’ healthcare information and set forth the conditions under which such \\n\\ninformation can be used, and to whom it can be disclosed. HIPAA privacy laws not only apply to \\n\\nhealthcare providers and the organizations they work for, but to any entity that may have access to \\n\\nhealthcare information about a patient that—if it were to fall into the wrong hands—could present \\n\\n26 \\n\\na risk of harm to the patient’s finances or reputation. \\n\\n27 \\n\\n164.

Plaintiff and the Nationwide Class re-allege and incorporate by reference herein all \\n\\nof the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 130. \\n\\n204.  Plaintiff and the Nationwide Class had a legitimate expectation of privacy to their \\n\\nPII  and  PHI  and  were  entitled  to  the  protection  of  this  information  against  disclosure  to \\n\\nunauthorized third parties. \\n\\n205.  Defendant owed a duty to its current and former patients, including Plaintiff and \\n\\nthe Nationwide Class, to keep their PII and PHI contained as a part thereof, confidential. \\n\\n206.  Defendant failed to protect and released to unknown and unauthorized third parties \\n\\nthe PII and PHI of Plaintiff and the Nationwide Class. \\n\\n207.  Defendant allowed unauthorized and unknown third parties to access and examine \\n\\nof the PII and PHI of Plaintiff and the Nationwide Class, by way of Defendant’s failure to protect \\n\\nthe PII and PHI. \\n\\n208.  The  unauthorized  release  to,  custody  of,  and  examination  by  unauthorized  third \\n\\nparties of the PII and PHI of Plaintiff and the Nationwide Class is highly offensive to a reasonable \\n\\nperson. \\n\\n209.  The  intrusion  was  into  a  place  or  thing,  which  was  private  and  is  entitled  to  be \\n\\nprivate. Plaintiff and the Nationwide Class disclosed their PII and PHI to Defendant as part of \\n\\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 43 \\n011073-11/1767047 V1 \\n\\n1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2000 • SEATTLE, WA 98101 \\n(206) 623-7292 • FAX (206) 623-0594 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0c1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\nPlaintiff’s and the Nationwide Class’s relationships with Defendant, but privately with an intention \\n\\nthat  the  PII  and  PHI  would  be  kept  confidential  and  would  be  protected  from  unauthorized \\n\\ndisclosure. Plaintiff and the Nationwide Class were reasonable in their belief that such information \\n\\nwould be kept private and would not be disclosed without their authorization. \\n\\n210.  The Data Breach at the hands of Defendant constitutes an intentional interference \\n\\nwith  Plaintiff’s  and  the  Nationwide  Class’s  interest  in  solitude  or  seclusion,  either  as  to  their \\n\\npersons or as to their private affairs or concerns, of a kind that would be highly offensive to a \\n\\nreasonable person. \\n\\n211.  Defendant acted with a knowing state of mind when it permitted the Data Breach \\n\\n10 \\n\\nto  occur  because  it  was  with  actual  knowledge  that  its  information  security  practices  were \\n\\n11 \\n\\ninadequate and insufficient. \\n\\n12 \\n\\n212.  Because Defendant acted with this knowing state of mind, it had notice and knew \\n\\n13 \\n\\nthe  inadequate  and  insufficient  information  security  practices  would  cause  injury  and  harm  to \\n\\n14 \\n\\nPlaintiff and the Nationwide Class. \\n\\n15 \\n\\n213.  As a proximate result of the above acts and omissions of Defendant, the PII and \\n\\n16 \\n\\nPHI  of  Plaintiff  and  the  Nationwide  Class  was disclosed to  third  parties  without  authorization, \\n\\n17 \\n\\ncausing Plaintiff and the Nationwide Class to suffer damages. \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n26 \\n\\n27 \\n\\n28 \\n\\n214.  Unless  and  until  enjoined,  and  restrained  by  order  of  this  Court,  Defendant’s \\n\\nwrongful  conduct  will  continue  to  cause  great  and  irreparable  injury  to  Plaintiff  and  the \\n\\nNationwide Class in that the PII and PHI maintained by Defendant can be viewed, distributed, and \\n\\nused  by  unauthorized  persons  for  years  to  come.  Plaintiff  and  the  Nationwide  Class  have  no \\n\\nadequate remedy at law for the injuries in that a judgment for monetary damages will not end the \\n\\ninvasion of privacy for Plaintiff and the Nationwide Class. \\n\\nCOUNT V \\n\\nBREACH OF CONFIDENCE  \\n(ON BEHALF OF PLAINTIFF AND THE NATIONWIDE CLASS) \\n\\n215.  Plaintiff and the Nationwide Class re-allege and incorporate by reference herein all \\n\\nof the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 130. \\n\\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 44 \\n011073-11/1767047 V1 \\n\\n1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2000 • SEATTLE, WA 98101 \\n(206) 623-7292 • FAX (206) 623-0594 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0c1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n216.  At  all  times  during  Plaintiff’s  and  the  Nationwide  Class’s  interactions  with \\n\\nDefendant, Defendant was fully aware of the confidential and sensitive nature of Plaintiff’s and \\n\\nthe Nationwide Class’s PII and PHI that Plaintiff and the Nationwide Class provided to Defendant. \\n\\n217.  As  alleged  herein  and  above,  Defendant’s  relationship  with  Plaintiff  and  the \\n\\nNationwide  Class  was  governed  by  terms  and  expectations  that  Plaintiff’s  and  the  Nationwide \\n\\nClass’s PII and PHI would be collected, stored, and protected in confidence, and would not be \\n\\ndisclosed to unauthorized third parties. \\n\\n218.  Plaintiff and the Nationwide Class provided their PII and PHI to Defendant with \\n\\nthe explicit and implicit understandings that Defendant would protect and not permit the PII and \\n\\n10 \\n\\nPHI to be disseminated to any unauthorized third parties. \\n\\n11 \\n\\n219.  Plaintiff and the Nationwide Class also provided their PII and PHI to Defendant \\n\\n12 \\n\\nwith the explicit and implicit understandings that Defendant would take precautions to protect that \\n\\n13 \\n\\nPII and PHI from unauthorized disclosure. \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n220.  Defendant voluntarily received in confidence the PII and PHI of Plaintiff and the \\n\\nNationwide Class with the understanding that PII and PHI would not be disclosed or disseminated \\n\\nto the public or any unauthorized third parties. \\n\\n221.  Due to Defendant’s failure to prevent and avoid the Data Breach from occurring, \\n\\nthe  PII  and  PHI  of  Plaintiff  and  the  Nationwide  Class  was  disclosed  and  misappropriated  to \\n\\n19 \\n\\nunauthorized third parties beyond Plaintiff’s and the Nationwide Class’s confidence, and without \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n26 \\n\\n27 \\n\\n28 \\n\\ntheir express permission. \\n\\n222.  As a direct and proximate cause of Defendant’s actions and/or omissions, Plaintiff \\n\\nand the Nationwide Class have suffered damages. \\n\\n223.  But for Defendant’s disclosure of Plaintiff’s and the Nationwide Class’s PII and \\n\\nPHI in violation of the parties’ understanding of confidence, their PII and PHI would not have \\n\\nbeen compromised by unauthorized third parties.  The Data Breach was the direct and legal cause \\n\\nof the theft of Plaintiff’s and the Nationwide Class’s PII and PHI as well as the resulting damages. \\n\\n224.  The injury and harm Plaintiff and the Nationwide Class suffered was the reasonably \\n\\nforeseeable result of Defendant’s unauthorized disclosure of Plaintiff’s and the Nationwide Class’s \\n\\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 45 \\n011073-11/1767047 V1 \\n\\n1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2000 • SEATTLE, WA 98101 \\n(206) 623-7292 • FAX (206) 623-0594 \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0c1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\nPII  and  PHI.    Defendant  knew  or  should  have  known  its  methods  of  accepting  and  securing \\n\\nPlaintiff’s and the Nationwide Class’s PII and PHI was inadequate as it relates to, at the very least, \\n\\nsecuring servers and other equipment containing Plaintiff’s and the Nationwide Class’s PII and \\n\\nPHI. \\n\\n225.  As  a  direct  and  proximate  result  of  Defendant’s  breach  of  its  confidence  with \\n\\nPlaintiff and the Nationwide Class, Plaintiff and the Nationwide Class have suffered and will suffer \\n\\ninjury, including, but not limited to: (i) actual identity theft; (ii) the loss of the opportunity how \\n\\ntheir PII and PHI is used; (iii) the compromise, publication, and/or theft of their PII and PHI; (iv) \\n\\nout-of-pocket expenses associated with the prevention, detection, and recovery from identity theft, \\n\\n10 \\n\\ntax fraud, and/or unauthorized use of their PII and PHI; (v) lost opportunity costs associated with \\n\\n11 \\n\\neffort expended and the loss of productivity addressing and attempting to mitigate the actual and \\n\\n12 \\n\\nfuture consequences of the Data Breach, including but not limited to efforts spent researching how \\n\\n13 \\n\\nto prevent, detect, contest, and recover from tax fraud and identity theft; (vi) costs associated with \\n\\n14 \\n\\nplacing freezes on credit reports; (vii) the continued risk to their PII and PHI, which remain in \\n\\n15 \\n\\nDefendant’s possession and is subject to further unauthorized disclosures so long as Defendant \\n\\n16 \\n\\nfails to undertake appropriate and adequate measures to protect the PII and PHI of Plaintiff and \\n\\n17 \\n\\nthe  Nationwide  Class;  and  (viii)  future  costs  in  terms  of  time,  effort,  and  money  that  will  be \\n\\n18 \\n\\nexpended to prevent, detect, contest, and repair the impact of the PII and PHI compromised as a \\n\\n19 \\n\\nresult of the Data Breach for the remainder of the lives of Plaintiff and the Nationwide Class. \\n\\n20 \\n\\n226.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breaches of confidence, Plaintiff \\n\\n21 \\n\\nand the Nationwide Class have suffered and will continue to suffer other forms of injury and/or \\n\\n22 \\n\\nharm, including, but not limited to, anxiety, emotional distress, loss of privacy, and other economic \\n\\n23 \\n\\nand non-economic losses. \\n\\n24 \\n\\n227.  As  a  result  of  Defendant’s  breaches  of  confidence,  Plaintiff  and  the  Nationwide \\n\\n25 \\n\\nClass are entitled to and demand actual, consequential, and nominal damages. \\n\\n26 \\n\\n27 \\n\\n28 \\n\\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 46 \\n011073-11/1767047 V1 \\n\\n1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2000 • SEATTLE, WA 98101 \\n(206) 623-7292 • FAX (206) 623-0594 \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0c1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\nCOUNT VI \\n\\nVIOLATION OF THE WASHINGTON CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT, \\n WASH.

Washington’s  Consumer  Protection  Act,  Wash.  Rev.

As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ deceptive trade practices, Plaintiff \\n\\nand the Washington Subclass suffered injury and/or damages. \\n\\n234.  The  above  unfair  and  deceptive  practices  and  acts  by  Defendant  were  immoral, \\n\\nunethical, oppressive, and unscrupulous. These acts caused substantial injury to consumers that \\n\\nthese consumers could not  reasonably avoid; this substantial injury outweighed any benefits to \\n\\nconsumers or to competition. \\n\\n235.  Defendants  knew  or  should  have  known  that  their  computer  systems  and  data \\n\\nsecurity practices were inadequate to safeguard the PII and PHI of Plaintiff and the Washington \\n\\nSubclass and that risk of a data breach or theft was highly likely. Defendant’s actions in engaging \\n\\n10 \\n\\nin the above-named unfair practices and deceptive acts were negligent, knowing and willful, and/or \\n\\n11 \\n\\nwanton and reckless with respect to the rights of Plaintiff and the Washington Subclass. \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n236.

Because Defendant discovered a breach of its security system (in which personal \\n\\ninformation was, or is reasonably believed to have been, acquired by an unauthorized person and \\n\\nthe personal information was not secured), Defendant had an obligation to disclose the data breach \\n\\nin a timely and accurate fashion as mandated by Wash.

If you detect any \\nsuspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is \\nmaintained. You also should promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidence of identity theft to proper \\nlaw enforcement authorities, your state attorney general, and/or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).\\n\\nCopy of Credit Report: You may obtain a free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting \\nagencies once every 12 months by visiting http://www.annualcreditreport.com/, calling toll-free 1-877-322-8228, or by \\ncompleting an Annual Credit Report Request Form and mailing it to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box \\n105281, Atlanta, GA 30348. You can print this form at www.annualcreditreport.com/cra/requestformfinal.pdf.

Box 1000\\nChester, PA 19016\\n1-800-916-8800\\nwww.transunion.com\\n\\nFraud Alert: You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will \\nstay on your credit file for at least one year. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report \\nand requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your \\ncredit report, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above. Additional information is available at \\nhttp://www.annualcreditreport.com.\\n\\nSecurity Freeze: You have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file for up to one year at no cost. This will \\nprevent new credit from being opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you \\ninitiate the freeze. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without \\nyour  consent. As  a  result,  using  a  security  freeze  may  interfere  with  or  delay  your  ability  to  obtain  credit.  You  must \\nseparately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. In order to place a security freeze, \\nyou may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full \\nname, Social Security Number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification \\ncard, and a recent utility bill, bank statement or insurance statement. \\n\\nAdditional Free Resources: You can obtain information from the consumer reporting agencies, the FTC, or from your \\nrespective state Attorney General about fraud alerts, security freezes, and steps you can take toward preventing identity \\ntheft.

You may be eligible to receive a cash payment as part of the Settlement.  \\nThis Notice explains the lawsuit, the Settlement, and your legal rights. \\n\\nJudge Robert S. Lasnik of the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington \\nis overseeing this class action.  The case is called Hall v. Sea Mar Community Health Centers, No. \\n2:22-cv-00184-RSL-TLF (the “Action”). \\n\\nAlan Hall, Jeffrie Alan Summers II, and Kristine Wright are the Plaintiffs or Class Representatives.  \\nThe company they sued, Sea Mar Community Health Centers, is the Defendant. \\n\\n2.  What is a class action lawsuit? \\n\\nA class action is a lawsuit in which one or more plaintiffs—in this case, Alan Hall, Jeffrie Alan \\nSummers II, and Kristine Wright —sue on behalf of a group of people who have similar claims.  \\nTogether, this group is called a “Class” and consists of “Class Members.”  In a class action, the \\ncourt resolves the issues for all class  members,  except  those who exclude  themselves  from the \\nclass.  After the Parties reached an agreement  to settle this case, the Court granted preliminary \\napproval of the Settlement and recognized it as a case that should be treated as a class action for \\nsettlement purposes. \\n\\nTHE CLAIMS IN THE LAWSUIT AND THE SETTLEMENT \\n\\n3.  What is this lawsuit about? \\n\\nThe Plaintiffs claim that Defendant failed to implement and maintain reasonable security measures \\nto protect patient, employee, and guarantor PII and PHI in its possession, in order to prevent the \\nData Incident from occurring.  \\n\\nDefendant  denies  that  it  is  or  can  be  held  liable  for  the  claims  made  in  the  lawsuit.

Why is there a Settlement? \\n\\nThe Court has not decided whether the Plaintiffs or Defendant should win this case.  Instead, both \\nsides agreed to this Settlement.  That way, they can avoid the uncertainty, risks, and expense of \\nongoing litigation, and Settlement Class Members will get compensation now rather than years \\nlater—if ever.   The Class Representative  and Class Counsel,  attorneys  for  the  Settlement Class \\nMembers,  agree  the  Settlement  is  in  the  best  interests  of  the  Settlement  Class Members.    The \\nSettlement is not an admission of wrongdoing by Defendant. \\n\\nWHO’S INCLUDED IN THE SETTLEMENT? \\n\\n5. \\n\\nHow do I know if I am in the Settlement Class? \\n\\nYou  are  part  of  the  Settlement  as  a Settlement  Class  Member if  you  had  an  address  on  file  in \\nDefendant’s  business  records  at  the  time  of  the  Data  Incident  and  your  PII  and/or  PHI  was \\n\\nQUESTIONS?

       " 'IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON \\n\\nNo. 84910-7-I \\n\\nDIVISION ONE \\n\\nPUBLISHED OPINION \\n\\nII,  on \\nJEFFRIE  ALAN  SUMMERS \\nbehalf of himself and all other similarly \\nsituated, \\n\\nRespondent, \\n\\nv. \\n\\nSEA MAR COMMUNITY HEALTH \\nCENTERS, \\n\\nRespondent, \\n\\nMARIA BARNES, objector to class \\naction settlement, \\n\\nAppellant. \\n\\nBIRK, J. — Maria Barnes appeals an order granting final approval to a class \\n\\naction  settlement,  challenging  the  superior  court’s  denial  of  her  motion  to \\n\\nconsolidate six class action lawsuits against the defendant, approval of the class \\n\\nnotice plan, and approval of the settlement as fair, reasonable, and adequate.  We \\n\\nhold the superior court acted within its discretion in making each ruling.  First, when \\n\\nthe court entertained consolidation, the proponents of two other pending actions \\n\\nhad reached a preliminary settlement with the defendant, and the superior court \\n\\nhad the discretion to review the potential settlement first, before coordinating the \\n\\npending actions.  Second, the parties agreed the class would be difficult to reach, \\n\\nand the superior court appropriately considered that difficulty in approving the class \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cNo. 84910-7-I/2 \\n\\nnotice plan as affording the best notice practicable under the circumstances.  Last, \\n\\nin  arguing  that  the  settlement  fell  outside  the  range  the  superior  court  had \\n\\ndiscretion to approve as fair, reasonable, and adequate, Barnes fails to point to \\n\\nmore  than  a  speculative  possibility  that  a  better  settlement  might  have  been \\n\\nachieved.  We affirm. \\n\\nI \\n\\nSea  Mar  Community  Health  Centers  is  a  nonprofit  organization  that \\n\\nprovides  healthcare  services  to  low-income,  underserved,  and  under-  and \\n\\nuninsured communities in Washington.  On June 24, 2021, Sea Mar learned from \\n\\nthe  United  States  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services  (HHS)  that  it  had \\n\\nsuffered  a  data  security  breach  when  certain  data  had  been  copied  by  an \\n\\nunauthorized actor.  On October 29, 2021, Sea Mar sent a notice letter to patients \\n\\nthat identified highly sensitive personal and protected health information, such as \\n\\nsocial security numbers and medical records, that may have been involved in the \\n\\ndata security incident.  The accessed data potentially impacted 1.2 million Sea Mar \\n\\npatients,  guarantors,  and  employees  and  included  social  security  numbers  for \\n\\n163,499 individuals.  There is no evidence of misuse of any information or that any \\n\\nof the data has been purchased by cybercriminals.   \\n\\nBetween mid-November 2021 and early February 2022, plaintiffs filed six \\n\\nseparate class action lawsuits against Sea Mar in King County Superior Court.1  \\n\\n1  Barnes  v.  Sea  Mar  Comty.  Health  Ctrs.,  No.  21-2-15063-9  SEA  (King \\nCounty Super. Ct. Wash. filed Nov. 12, 2021); Hall v. Sea Mar Comty. Health Ctrs, \\nNo. 21-2-15130-9 SEA (King County Super. Ct. Wash. filed Nov. 12, 2021); Lopez \\nv. Sea Mar Comty. Heath Ctrs., No. 21-2-16263-7 SEA (King County Super Ct. \\nWash.  filed  Dec.  13,  2021);  Waliany  v.  Sea  Mar  Comty.  Heath  Ctrs.,  No.  21-2-\\n\\n2 \\n\\n                                            \\n \\n\\x0cNo. 84910-7-I/3 \\n\\nMaria  Barnes  and  Derek  Gannon  filed  the  first  action.    Only  Jeffrie  Summers’s \\n\\ncomplaint  is  before  us  on  appeal,  which,  based  on  the  data  breach  incident \\n\\ndescribed above, alleged several Washington common law and statutory claims \\n\\nagainst Sea Mar.  Summers and Alan Hall were represented by the same counsel \\n\\nin  different  lawsuits  and  later  submitted  filings  jointly.    On  January  14,  2022, \\n\\naccording to a Sea Mar attorney’s declaration, Hall served Sea Mar with discovery \\n\\nrequests.  On the due date for response, according to the same declaration, Sea \\n\\nMar responded by producing responsive documents.  On February 8, 2022, Sea \\n\\nMar notified HHS of the pending litigation and requested certification that Sea Mar \\n\\nacted within the scope of a deemed public health services employee.  Barnes v. \\n\\nSea  Mar  Cmty.  Health  Ctrs.,  No.  2:22-181-RSL-TLF,  2022  WL  1541927,  at  *1 \\n\\n(W.D. Wash. Apr. 27, 2022) (report and recommendation).  On February 11, 2022, \\n\\na U.S. attorney filed a notice pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 233(l)(1) advising the superior \\n\\ncourt  that  the  United  States  was  considering  whether  the  United  States  would \\n\\nintervene in the action.  Id.   \\n\\nOn February 14, 2022, Barnes2 filed a motion to consolidate the six pending \\n\\nclass  action  lawsuits.    In  a  declaration  supporting  the  motion,  Barnes’s  counsel \\n\\nstated  he  contacted  counsel  for  plaintiffs  in  the  other  five  actions  and  obtained \\n\\nconsent  from  counsel  in  the  Lopez  and  Waliany  actions  to  a  stipulated \\n\\n16813-9  SEA  (King  County  Super.  Ct.  Wash.  filed  Dec.  23,  2021);  Summers  v. \\nSea  Mar  Comty.  Health  Ctrs.,  No.  22-2-00773-7  SEA  (King  County  Super  Ct. \\nWash.  filed  Jan.  14,  2022);  Maynor  v.  Sea  Mar  Comty.  Health  Ctrs.,  No.  22-2-\\n01713-9 SEA (King County Super. Ct. Wash. filed February 2, 2022). \\n\\n2 Throughout the proceedings in the trial court, different plaintiffs joined at \\ndifferent times in different filings.  We omit those not necessary to the discussion. \\n\\n3 \\n\\n                                            \\n \\n\\x0cNo. 84910-7-I/4 \\n\\nconsolidation.  Counsel for plaintiff in Hall did not agree to consolidation, counsel \\n\\nfor  plaintiff  in  Summers  declined  to  respond,  and  counsel  for  plaintiff  in  Maynor \\n\\nnever provided a position on consolidation.   \\n\\nOn February 16, 2022, Sea Mar filed notices of removal of Summers and \\n\\nBarnes to federal court.  Barnes, 2022 WL 1541927, at *1.  In its notice of removal \\n\\nof action under 28 U.S.C. § 1346(b)(1), Sea Mar argued the Public Health Services \\n\\nAct (PHSA) and Federally Supported Health Centers Assistance Act (FSHCAA), \\n\\n42 U.S.C. § 233(a), granted Sea Mar immunity from liability and Summers’s only \\n\\nredress  was  to  sue  the  United  States  in  federal  court  as  Summers’s  claims  fell \\n\\nunder the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1346(b).  On February 28, 2022, \\n\\nthe  superior  court  struck  Barnes’s  motion  to  consolidate,  noting  Sea  Mar  had \\n\\nsought removal to federal court.   \\n\\nOn  March  29,  2022,  Hall,  Summers,  and  Sea  Mar  engaged  in  an \\n\\nunsuccessful mediation.  A former federal judge served as the parties’ mediator.  \\n\\nBefore  mediation,  Sea  Mar  “provided  formal  discovery  related  to  the  merits  of \\n\\nPlaintiffs’ claims, potential defenses,” and the parties “discussed their respective \\n\\npositions  on  the  merits  of  the  claims  and  class  certification.”    Following  the \\n\\nunsuccessful  mediation,  the  parties  continued  negotiations  and  accepted  a \\n\\nmediator’s proposal to settle the class claims.   \\n\\nBy  April  18,  2022,  Hall,  Summers,  and  Sea  Mar  signed  a  settlement \\n\\nagreement  and  release.    The  settlement  was  subject  to  court  approval.    The \\n\\nagreement would release, discharge, and bar all claims asserted or that could have \\n\\nbeen asserted in the Hall lawsuit or any related action, including Barnes, Lopez, \\n\\n4 \\n\\n\\x0cNo. 84910-7-I/5 \\n\\nWaliany,  Summers,  and  Maynor.    Under  the  terms  of  the  agreement,  Sea  Mar \\n\\nwould  provide  compensation  for  unreimbursed  “Ordinary  Losses”  to  a  total  of \\n\\n$2,500.00 per person upon submission of a timely, complete, and valid claim form \\n\\nwith necessary supporting documentation.  In the alternative, class members may \\n\\nmake  a  claim  for  a  $100.00  cash  payment.    Class  members  who  suffer \\n\\n“Extraordinary  Losses”  are  “also”  eligible  to  receive  reimbursement  up  to \\n\\n$25,000.00.  The agreement entitles all settlement class members to enroll in IDX \\n\\nIdentity Protection Services for three years of three-bureau credit monitoring.  IDX \\n\\ncarries a $1 million policy that protects the subscriber, monitors the dark web, and \\n\\nprovides  identity  restoration  services.    Sea  Mar  funded  a  non-reversionary \\n\\nsettlement fund totaling $4,400,000.00.  If the total of settlement payments, IDX \\n\\nprotection services, attorney fees and costs, and other fixed settlement costs does \\n\\nnot exceed the settlement fund, all remaining funds will be distributed on a pro rata \\n\\nbasis to all settlement class members who submit a valid claim up to an additional \\n\\n$100.00 for each claimant.  Any remaining funds after that distribution will be paid \\n\\nto  a  cy  pres  recipient  to  be  agreed  upon  by  the  parties  and  subject  to  court \\n\\napproval.   \\n\\nFor  class  notice,  the  proposed  settlement  stated,  “[T]he  Settlement \\n\\nAdministrator  shall  disseminate”  postcard  notice  “via  [U.S.  Postal  Service]  First \\n\\nClass  Mail  to  all  Settlement  Class  Members.”    This  was  to  be  done  using \\n\\n“addresses provided by Sea Mar” and after those addresses had been updated \\n\\nwith  the  National  Change  of  Address  database.    In  addition,  the  settlement \\n\\n5 \\n\\n\\x0cNo. 84910-7-I/6 \\n\\nadministrator  was  to  establish  a  settlement  website  and  a  toll-free  telephone \\n\\nnumber for the class members to obtain information.   \\n\\nOn April 27, 2022, United States Magistrate Judge Theresa Fricke entered \\n\\na report and recommendation.  Barnes, 2022 WL 1541927, at *1.  According to the \\n\\nreport, the United States filed two notices advising the court that it determined Sea \\n\\nMar was not deemed a Public Health Service employee under 42 U.S.C.  § 233 \\n\\nand removal was procedurally improper.  Id.  The magistrate judge recommended \\n\\nthe court find that removal under the FSHCAA was procedurally deficient and 42 \\n\\nU.S.C. § 233 did not confer subject matter jurisdiction over the action.  Id. at *2.  \\n\\nThe magistrate judge recommended Sea Mar’s motion to stay be denied because \\n\\na stay is automatic only when an action is properly removed under  42 U.S.C. § \\n\\n233(l)(2).  Id. at *3.     \\n\\nOn May 4, 2022, Sea Mar filed a joint motion to remand Summers back to \\n\\nKing County Superior Court, which the federal court granted the following day.  On \\n\\nMay  16,  2022,  United  States  District  Judge  Robert  Lasnik  entered  an  order \\n\\nadopting Judge Fricke’s report and recommendation and remanded Barnes back \\n\\nto King County Superior Court.  Barnes v. Sea Mar Cmty. Health Ctrs., No. C22-\\n\\n0181RSL-TLF, 2022 WL 1540462, at *1 (W.D. Wash. May 16, 2022) (court order).   \\n\\nOn  May  20,  2022,  Barnes  filed  a  motion  to  consolidate  her  lawsuit  with \\n\\nSummers  and  Hall.    Barnes  argued  the  remaining  three  lawsuits  should  be \\n\\nconsolidated  after  remand  from  federal  court.    Hall,  Summers,  and  Sea  Mar \\n\\nopposed Barnes’s motion because “consolidation under CR 42(a) is unwarranted” \\n\\n6 \\n\\n\\x0cNo. 84910-7-I/7 \\n\\nsince  “this  class  action  case  has  been  settled.”    On  June  3,  2022,  the  superior \\n\\ncourt denied Barnes’s motion to consolidate.   \\n\\nOn June 17, 2022, Summers, on behalf of himself, Hall, and Wright, filed an \\n\\n“Unopposed  Motion  for  Preliminary  Approval  of  Class  Action  Settlement  and \\n\\nMemorandum in Support.”  On June 29, 2022, Barnes filed a motion to intervene \\n\\nin Summers and an objection to Summers’s motion for preliminary approval.  In \\n\\nopposing  Summers’s  motion,  Barnes  argued  Hall,  Summers,  and  Sea  Mar  had \\n\\nentered into a collusive settlement that should be rejected, and the court should \\n\\nconsolidate the pending actions.  The superior court granted Summers’s motion \\n\\nfor  preliminary  approval  of  class  action  settlement.    The  order  appointed  the \\n\\nattorneys for  Hall  and  Summers as class  counsel and  appointed  Kroll  Business \\n\\nServices as the settlement administrator.  The court approved the proposed notice \\n\\nplan.    The  court  denied  Barnes’s  motion  to  intervene.    Later,  Barnes  filed  an \\n\\nobjection  to  final  approval  of  the  class  action  settlement,  arguing  the  proposed \\n\\nsettlement was not fair, reasonable, and adequate.   \\n\\nHall  and  Summers  subsequently  filed  a  motion  for  final  approval  of  the \\n\\nsettlement.  Before the final fairness hearing, the settlement administrator engaged \\n\\nin an online media campaign on Facebook and Instagram3 in English and Spanish, \\n\\nwhich  was  substantially  completed  in  a  month  and  generated  over  eight  million \\n\\nimpressions.  At the time of the final fairness hearing, 6,210 claims forms had been \\n\\nreceived out of a possible 1,179,596 class members, representing a response rate \\n\\nof approximately 0.5 percent.  As to Barnes’s objection, the court ruled that “[w]hile \\n\\n3 Instagram is a social media platform for sharing photographs. \\n\\n7 \\n\\n                                            \\n\\x0cNo. 84910-7-I/8 \\n\\nthe  Court  denies  the  objection,”  it  found  that  “valid  objections  exist.”    The  court \\n\\nexplained that “[o]n balance . . . the Court finds the settlement to be fair, adequate, \\n\\nand  reasonable.”    The  court  entered  a  final  order  and  judgment  granting  final \\n\\napproval of the class action settlement.  The court also granted Summers’s motion \\n\\nfor attorney fees, costs, and service award.   \\n\\nBarnes appeals.   \\n\\nII \\n\\nClass actions are governed by CR 23.  Washington’s CR 23 was once “an \\n\\nexact counter-part” of Rule 23 of theFederal Rules of Civil Procedure (Fed. R. Civ. \\n\\nP.).  Johnson v. Moore, 80 Wn.2d 531, 532, 496 P.2d 334 (1972).  The court stated \\n\\nthe Washington rule was “identical” to the federal rule in Lacey Nursing Center, \\n\\nInc. v. Department of Revenue, 128 Wn.2d 40, 46-47, 905 P.2d 338 (1995), Pickett \\n\\nv. Holland America Line-Westours, Inc., 145 Wn.2d 178, 188, 35 P.3d 351 (2001), \\n\\nand Schnall v. AT & T Wireless Services, Inc., 171 Wn.2d 260, 271, 259 P.3d 129 \\n\\n(2011).    CR  23  is  no  longer  “identical”  to  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  23  because  of \\n\\namendments to the federal rule.  However, Washington courts may look to federal \\n\\ndecisions in applying the Washington rules of civil procedure when the Washington \\n\\nand  federal  rules  are  “substantially  similar.”    Bryant  v.  Joseph  Tree,  Inc.,  119 \\n\\nWn.2d 210, 218-19, 829 P.2d 1099 (1992).  In class actions, Washington courts \\n\\nhave long looked to federal authority.  See DeFunis v. Odegaard, 84 Wn.2d 617, \\n\\n622-23, 529 P.2d 438 (1974); Johnson, 80 Wn.2d at 533.  It remains appropriate \\n\\nto consider federal decisions in applying CR 23 when there is not a Washington \\n\\ndecision  speaking  to  the  issue,  the  text  of  the  two  rules  does  not  indicate \\n\\n8 \\n\\n\\x0cNo. 84910-7-I/9 \\n\\ndivergence,  and  the  rules  in  respect  to  their  goals  and  purposes  remain \\n\\nsubstantially similar. \\n\\nAt the outset, Barnes takes issue with the superior court’s interlineation of \\n\\nits observation that Barnes presented “valid” objections, but that, “on balance” the \\n\\nsettlement was fair, adequate, and reasonable.  Barnes argues if the court found \\n\\n“any part” of her objections valid, “it could not have appropriately approved” the \\n\\nsettlement.    We  reject  this  characterization  of  the  superior  court’s  interlineation.  \\n\\nDuring  the  hearing  on  final  approval  of  the  class  settlement,  the  superior  court \\n\\nexpressed concern about the adequacy of notice, the content of the release, and \\n\\nthe removal to federal court.  In context, the superior court’s interlineation shows, \\n\\nconsistent with the final fairness hearing transcript, the court made the appropriate \\n\\nsearching  inquiry  into  concerns  that  were  validly  presented  for  the  protection  of \\n\\nabsent  class  members,  but  concluded  the  settlement  met  those  concerns  and \\n\\nproperly served the class’s interest.   \\n\\nA \\n\\nBarnes  argues  the  superior  court  abused  its  discretion  by  denying  her \\n\\nmotion to consolidate the six actions.  We disagree. \\n\\nWhen  actions  involving  a  common  question  of  law  or  fact  are  pending \\n\\nbefore the court, it may order a joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue \\n\\nin the actions, or may order the actions consolidated.  CR 42(a).  The rule allows \\n\\na  trial  court  to  make  such  orders  “as  may  tend  to  avoid  unnecessary  costs  or \\n\\ndelay.”  Id.  CR 42(a) is permissive.  See Leader Nat’l Ins. Co. v. Torres, 51 Wn. \\n\\nApp.  136,  142,  751  P.2d  1252  (1988),  affirmed,  113  Wn.2d  366,  779  P.2d  722 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n\\x0cNo. 84910-7-I/10 \\n\\n(1989).  Consolidation is within the discretion of the trial court.  Nat’l Bank of Wash. \\n\\nv.  Equity  Inv’rs,  86  Wn.2d  545,  560,  546  P.2d  440  (1976).    A  decision  denying \\n\\nconsolidation will be affirmed unless there has been an abuse of discretion, and \\n\\nthe moving party shows prejudice.  Id.  A superior court abuses its discretion when \\n\\nits decision is manifestly unreasonable, based on untenable grounds, or based on \\n\\nuntenable reasons.  State v. Dye, 178 Wn.2d 541, 548, 309 P.3d 1192 (2013). \\n\\nBarnes  sought  to  have  the  court  organize  the  six  actions  and  plaintiffs’ \\n\\ncounsel  to  pursue  the  claims  against  Sea  Mar  in  common.    The  Manual  for \\n\\nComplex Litigation, Fourth, published in 2004, was produced under the auspices \\n\\nof the Federal Judicial Center, and contains analyses and recommendations of its \\n\\nboard of editors.  FED. JUD. CTR., MANUAL FOR COMPLEX LITIGATION, at 1 (4th ed. \\n\\n2004)  (Manual),  https://www.fjc.gov/sites/default/files/materials/30/Manual%20for \\n\\n%20Complex%20Litigation_Fourth%20Edition_Third%20Printing_2020.pdf.    The \\n\\nManual  is  not  “authoritative  legal  or  administrative  policy,”  but  sets  forth  only \\n\\n“recommendations  and  suggestions.”    Id.    Barnes  cited  section  22.62  of  the \\n\\nManual,  which  discusses  the  organization  of  counsel.    It  states,  “The  judge  will \\n\\noften  need  to  appoint  lead  counsel  or  a  committee  of  counsel  to  coordinate \\n\\ndiscovery and other pretrial preparation.”  Id. § 22.62, at 405-06.  After discussing \\n\\nthe  role of lead counsel and  committees  of counsel,  the  Manual  states, “Where \\n\\nseveral  counsel  are  competing  to  be  lead  counsel  or  to  serve  on  a  key  liaison \\n\\ncommittee, the  court should establish  a procedure  for  attorneys to  present  their \\n\\nqualifications,  including  their  experience  in  managing  complex  litigation.”    Id.  at \\n\\n406.  In a complex case, lead counsel assume major responsibility on behalf of the \\n\\n10 \\n\\n\\x0cNo. 84910-7-I/11 \\n\\nclass for presenting written and oral arguments, working with opposing counsel in \\n\\ndeveloping  and  implementing  plans  for  the  litigation,  initiating  and  organizing \\n\\ndiscovery, conducting depositions, and employing experts, among other tasks.  In \\n\\nre Ivan F. Boesky Sec. Litig., 948 F.2d 1358, 1365 (2d Cir. 1991).  Appointing a \\n\\nsingle  negotiator  authorized  to  speak  for  the  class  eliminates  opportunities  for \\n\\n“divisive settlement shopping” by the defendant.  Id. (citing MacAlister v. Guterma, \\n\\n263 F.2d 65, 68-69 (2d Cir. 1958)).   \\n\\nOne  of  the  ways  in  which  current  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  23  differs  from \\n\\nWashington’s  rule  is  in  establishing  express  considerations  relevant  to  the \\n\\nappointment of class counsel.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g).  Washington’s CR 23 lacks \\n\\nsimilar express considerations, stating only, in CR 23(a)(4), that the representative \\n\\nparties must fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.  The federal \\n\\nrule states additionally, in reference to class counsel, “If more than one adequate \\n\\napplicant  seeks  appointment,  the  court  must  appoint  the  applicant  best  able  to \\n\\nrepresent the interests of the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(2).  And, “[t]he court \\n\\nmay  designate  interim  counsel  to  act  on  behalf  of  a  putative  class  before \\n\\ndetermining  whether  to  certify  the  action  as  a  class  action.”    Fed.  R.  Civ.  P. \\n\\n23(g)(3).  These appointments turn on “the same factors” used to appoint class \\n\\ncounsel generally.  E.g. In re Vanguard Chester Funds Litig., 625 F. Supp. 3d 362, \\n\\n365  (E.D.  Pa.  2022).    While  the  provisions  of  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  23(g)  are  more \\n\\nspecific, Washington law is consistent.  It requires that class counsel be “qualified, \\n\\nexperienced, and generally able to conduct the litigation.”  Marquardt v. Fein, 25 \\n\\nWn. App. 651, 656-57, 612 P.2d 378 (1980) (citing Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, \\n\\n11 \\n\\n\\x0cNo. 84910-7-I/12 \\n\\n391  F.2d  555,  562  (2d  Cir.  1968)).    Because  the  court  has  responsibility  for \\n\\n“insuring adequate representation” of the class, the court may appoint lead counsel \\n\\nadequate to the complexity of an action.  Id.  \\n\\nAt  the  time  of  Barnes’s  motion  to  consolidate,  Hall  and  Summers’s \\n\\npreliminary settlement subject to court approval stood to potentially eliminate the \\n\\nneed  for  future  litigation  on  behalf  of  the  class,  and  therefore  the  need  for \\n\\nefficiencies associated with designating lead counsel to manage litigation tasks.  \\n\\nAt  any  point  at  which  it  seemed  probable  that  future  litigation  would  occur  that \\n\\nwould  benefit  from  consolidation  and  appointment  of  lead  counsel,  the  superior \\n\\ncourt might have revisited the question of consolidation.  But when a settlement, if \\n\\napproved, had the potential to resolve the class’s claims, the superior court acted \\n\\nwithin its discretion in denying consolidation where it would not save cost or time, \\n\\nand  to  the  contrary  could  delay  review  of  the  preliminary  settlement.    Further, \\n\\nBarnes was not prejudiced, because her opportunity to opt out of or object to the \\n\\nclass settlement was preserved.  The superior court did not abuse its discretion by \\n\\ndenying consolidation in the circumstances presented.4 \\n\\n4  The  order  denying  consolidation  did  not  state  a  basis  for  the  superior \\ncourt’s  ruling.    To  the  extent  this  was  error  it  was  harmless  because  “there  is \\nevidence to support the decision in the pleadings and proof,” In re Dependency of \\nN.G., 199 Wn.2d 588, 600, 510 P.3d 335 (2022), and because Barnes’s right to \\nobject  was  preserved  it  affirmatively  appears  from  the  record  that  no  injustice \\noccurred, see Foster v. Carter, 49 Wn. App. 340, 343, 742 P.2d 1257 (1987) (no \\ninjustice occurred where the superior court waived rules concerning the time to file \\na summary judgment motion because appellant had received appropriate notice). \\n\\n12 \\n\\n                                            \\n\\x0cNo. 84910-7-I/13 \\n\\nB \\n\\nBarnes  argues  the  class  notice  plan  was  not  the  best  notice  practicable \\n\\nunder the circumstances, and in fact, “ ‘failed.’ ”5  We disagree. \\n\\nA class action may not be settled without notice to the class.  CR 23(e).  In \\n\\na class action maintained under CR 23(b)(3), the court is required to “direct to class \\n\\nmembers ‘the best notice practicable under the circumstances including individual \\n\\nnotice to all members who can be identified through reasonable effort.’ ”  Eisen v. \\n\\nCarlisle, 417 U.S. 156, 173, 94 S. Ct. 2140, 40 L. Ed. 2d 732 (1974) (quoting Fed. \\n\\nR. Civ. P. 23(c)(2)); CR 23(c)(2); Sitton v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 116 Wn. \\n\\nApp. 245, 252 n.11, 63 P.3d 198 (2003).  This is notice “ ‘reasonably calculated, \\n\\nunder all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the \\n\\naction and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.’ ”  Roes, 1-2 v. \\n\\nSFBSC Mgmt., LLC, 944 F.3d 1035, 1045 (9th Cir. 2019) (internal quotation marks \\n\\nomitted)  (quoting  Eisen,  417  U.S.  at  174).    It  requires  the  means  one  “ ‘might \\n\\nreasonably adopt’ ” when “ ‘desirous of actually informing the absentee.’ ”  Id. at \\n\\n1045-46 (quoting Mullane v. Cent. Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306, 315, \\n\\n70 S. Ct. 652, 94 L. Ed. 865 (1950)). \\n\\nThe Advisory Committee note to the 2018 amendments to Fed. R. Civ. P. \\n\\n23(c)(2)  addressed  the  evolution  in  technology  since  the  U.S.  Supreme  Court \\n\\naddressed the notice requirement in Eisen.  While its individual notice requirement \\n\\n5  Barnes  does  not  challenge  on  appeal  the  content  of  the  notice.  \\nAccordingly, we do not address its adequacy.  See Nobl Park, LLC. of Vancouver \\nv.  Shell  Oil  Co.,  122  Wn.  App.  838,  845,  95  P.3d  1265  (2004)  (setting  out \\nrequirements for adequacy of notice) (citing Phillips Petroleum Co. v.

R.  Civ.  P.  23(c)(2),  Committee  Note  2018.    The  committee \\n\\ncommented  that  “when  selecting  a  method  or  methods  of  giving  notice  courts \\n\\nshould  consider  the  capacity  and  limits  of  current  technology,  including  class \\n\\nmembers’ likely access to such technology.”  Id.  The focus should be on the “the \\n\\nmeans or combination of means most likely to be effective in the case before the \\n\\ncourt.”  Id. \\n\\n“[T]he  superior  court  exercises  discretion  under  CR  23(d)  in  crafting  an \\n\\nappropriate procedure for giving notice of a class action.”  Wright v. Jeckle, 121 \\n\\nWn.  App.  624,  629  n.1,  90  P.3d  65  (2004).    This  accords  with  the  abuse  of \\n\\ndiscretion standard that we apply generally when reviewing a superior court ruling \\n\\nthat a class settlement was fair, adequate, and reasonable.  Pickett, 145 Wn.2d at \\n\\n192; Deien v. Seattle City Light, 26 Wn. App. 2d 57, 66, 527 P.3d 102 (2023).  We \\n\\ntherefore review for abuse of discretion the superior court’s determination that the \\n\\nnotice plan was the best notice practicable under the circumstances.6    \\n\\n6 Consistent with Wright, Pickett and Deien, the parties agree that we review \\nthe  superior  court’s  approval  of  class  notice  under  the  abuse  of  discretion \\nstandard.    We  note  appellate  courts  are  divided  on  the  standard  of  review  that \\napplies  to  orders  concerning  class  notice.    Some  courts  view  the  notice \\nrequirement as calling on the trial court to assess and adopt a plan from among \\nthe  “feasible  alternative[s]”  suitable  to  a  particular  case  for  “identifying  and \\ncontacting persons” in the class, and apply an abuse of discretion standard.  In re \\nAgent Orange Prod. Liab. Litig. MDL No. 381, 818 F.2d 145, 169 (2d Cir. 1987); \\nsee  also  Pollard  v.

Id.   \\n\\nThe Ninth Circuit  reversed the district court’s approval of the notice plan.  \\n\\nId. at 1046, 1048.  The court was troubled by the parties’ use of U.S. mail without \\n\\nany  additional  means  of  notice  despite  believing  beforehand  that  the  class, \\n\\nespecially  former  employees,  would  be  difficult  to  reach  that  way,  and  knowing \\n\\nafterwards that 12 percent of the class received no notice.  Id. at 1046.  This was \\n\\nexacerbated by the notice plan’s failure to employ any electronic means of notice, \\n\\nor offer any reminder notice.  Id.  The supplemental notice consisting of posters \\n\\ndisplayed  at  the  night  clubs  would  alert  only  current  employees,  and  in  no  way \\n\\nanswered the difficulty understood to exist in reaching former employees.

Between the known limitations of the \\n\\nplan  that  was  implemented  together  with  the  neglect  of  available  options  to \\n\\nameliorate those limitations, the court held “something more was required” to meet \\n\\nthe standard of the “ ‘best notice practicable.’ ”  Id. at 1048.   \\n\\n16 \\n\\n\\x0cNo. 84910-7-I/17 \\n\\nWhile the parties here also anticipated difficulty in reaching the class, they \\n\\ndid not rely on only one means of reaching the class, let alone as in Roes, 1-2 a \\n\\nparticular means they believed in advance would be ineffective.  The parties here \\n\\ndid “something more” than the parties did in  Roes, 1-2, by using first class mail \\n\\nwhen  addresses  were  known  and  using  e-mail  when  e-mail  addresses  were \\n\\nknown,7 establishing a website and toll-free telephone number, and using online \\n\\nadvertising on Facebook and Instagram in English and Spanish.  Over eight million \\n\\nimpressions  were  delivered  via  the  Facebook  and  Instagram  advertising \\n\\ncampaigns.  The record does not indicate a design in the social media advertising \\n\\nto target groups likely to overlap with the class, and does not indicate the existence \\n\\nof a website known to be used by a community overlapping with the class, but with \\n\\nthose  exceptions  the  notice  employed  here  did  use  the  “numerous  other \\n\\nreasonable options” insofar as those are identified in Roes, 1-2.   \\n\\nAdditionally, as Sea-Mar argued, the superior court was entitled to consider \\n\\nthe nonreversionary nature of the settlement when evaluating a notice plan for a \\n\\n7 Barnes argues that Hall and Summers improperly deviated from the notice \\nplan  approved  by  the  court  when  Kroll  e-mailed  notices  to  180,513  e-mail \\naddresses  on  file  for  the  class  members.    Of  the  180,513  e-mail  addresses \\ncontacted, 34,205 “were rejected/bounced back,” and Kroll was able to follow up \\nwith  first  class  mail  notice  to  33,070  of  those  recipients.    This  case  differs  from \\nRoes, 1-2 in that the settling parties here used e-mail addresses if they had them, \\notherwise postal addresses, and then postal addresses if available for defective e-\\nmail  addresses.    Better  practice  would  have  been  to  return  to  court  to  obtain \\napproval of the procedure actually employed, but Barnes fails to show prejudice \\nfrom any deviation from the original plan.  In effect, Barnes argues that substituting \\ne-mail  for  first  class  mail  notice  for  approximately  13  percent  of  the  class  was \\nimproper.    When  coupled  with  Barnes’s  argument  that  first  class  mail  was \\ninadequate, this impliedly amounts to an argument that only sending both e-mail \\nand  first  class  mail  when  such  addresses  were  known  could  have  potentially \\nsatisfied CR 23.  Barnes cites no authority supporting this contention. \\n\\n17 \\n\\n                                            \\n\\x0cNo. 84910-7-I/18 \\n\\nclass known to be difficult to reach.  Funds unclaimed by class members do not \\n\\nrevert to Sea Mar, but must be paid over to an appropriate cy pres recipient.  See \\n\\nCR 23(f)(2) (directing residual funds to “programs that promote access to the civil \\n\\njustice  system  for  low  income  residents  of  Washington”  and  for  purposes  that \\n\\nrelate  to  “the  objectives  of  the  underlying  litigation  or  otherwise  promote  the \\n\\nsubstantive or procedural interest of members of the certified class.”).  This also \\n\\ndistinguishes  Roes,  1-2,  in  which  significant  amounts  of  the  proposed  class \\n\\nsettlement would never be funded or would revert to the defendants if not claimed \\n\\nby the class members.  944 F.3d at 1040-41.  When the “distribution of unclaimed \\n\\nfunds” is designed to “indirectly benefit the entire class,” the court may consider \\n\\nthis as a factor mitigating the infeasibility of providing individual notice to persons \\n\\nwho are difficult to reach, while still giving them the benefits of the class form.  See \\n\\nSix (6) Mexican Workers v.  Ariz. Citrus Growers, 904 F.2d 1301, 1305 (9th Cir. \\n\\n1990) (“Fluid recovery or ‘cy pres’ distribution avoids these difficulties by permitting \\n\\naggregate  calculation  of  damages,  the  use  of  summary  claim  procedures,  and \\n\\ndistribution of unclaimed funds to indirectly benefit the entire class.”).  Factoring \\n\\nthe  cy  pres  provision  into  the  evaluation  of  the  notice  plan  is  appropriate  to  the \\n\\npurpose  of  cy  pres  distributions,  which  are  justified  when  a  recovery  cannot \\n\\n“feasibly”  be  distributed  to  the  “intended  beneficiaries.”    Pearson  v.  NBTY,  Inc., \\n\\n772 F.3d 778, 784 (7th Cir. 2014).  \\n\\nBarnes argues the low response rate from the class shows that the notice \\n\\nplan was inadequate.  The law generally does not view a low response rate from \\n\\nthe class as necessarily an indicator of inadequate notice, as opposed only to a \\n\\n18 \\n\\n\\x0cNo. 84910-7-I/19 \\n\\nfactor  that  may  be  considered.    Pollard  v.  Remington  Arms  Co.,  LLC,  896  F.3d \\n\\n900, 906 (8th Cir. 2018) (“In the end, the low claim submission rate, while not ideal, \\n\\nis not necessarily indicative of a deficient notice plan.”); In re Prudential Ins. Co. \\n\\nAm. Sales Practice Litig. Agent Actions, 148 F.3d 283, 318 n.63 (3d Cir. 1998).  \\n\\nCharacterizing a claims rate as high or low depends on the context of the relief a \\n\\nproposed settlement affords.  McAdams v. Robinson, 26 F.4th 149, 154 n.4 (4th \\n\\nCir. 2022).   \\n\\nOne court has cited evidence that “response rates in class actions generally \\n\\nrange from 1 to 12 percent, with a median response rate of 5 to 8 percent.”  Gascho \\n\\nv. Glob. Fitness Holdings, LLC, 822 F.3d 269, 290 (6th Cir. 2016); accord Jones \\n\\nv. Monsanto Co., 38 F.4th 693, 698 (8th Cir. 2022), cert. denied, 143 S. Ct. 2458 \\n\\n(2023)  (“ ‘a  claim  rate  as  low  as  3  percent  is  hardly  unusual  in  consumer  class \\n\\nactions and does not suggest unfairness.’ ”) (quoting Keil v. Lopez, 862 F.3d 685, \\n\\n697  (8th  Cir.  2017));  Sullivan  v.  DB  Invs., Inc.,  667  F.3d  273,  329  n.60 (3d  Cir. \\n\\n2011) (“ ‘[C]onsumer claim filing rates rarely exceed seven percent, even with the \\n\\nmost extensive notice campaigns.’ ”) (quoting App’x 1550)).  In Roes, 1-2, the court \\n\\nviewed a response rate of 18.5 percent as low, but that case was not a consumer \\n\\nclass action or specifically a data breach claim, but an employee classification case \\n\\nin which class members “stood to receive hundreds of dollars if they made a claim.”  \\n\\n944 F.3d at 1046 n.7.  In Pearson, the court was critical of a class settlement in \\n\\nwhich  the  claims  rate  was  0.25  percent  overall  and,  for  those  who  received \\n\\npostcards,  0.64  percent,  but  the  court’s  criticism  came  in  the  context  of  other \\n\\nsignificant concerns including excessive attorney fees, a reversionary fund, and an \\n\\n19 \\n\\n\\x0cNo. 84910-7-I/20 \\n\\nagreement that attorney fees the court did not permit to be paid to class counsel \\n\\nalso  would  revert  to  the  defendants,  leading  the  court  to  conclude  the  claims \\n\\nprocess had been structured to discourage claims.  772 F.3d at 780, 782-83.   \\n\\nIn contrast, Pollard was a class action on behalf of the then “current” owners \\n\\nof  “approximately  7.5  million”  firearms  produced  since  1948.    896  F.3d  at  903.  \\n\\nInitially, notice consisted of circulation for 24 months between February 2015 and \\n\\nFebruary 2017 of postcard notices, magazine notices, posters, website postings, \\n\\ninternet  banners,  and  Facebook  advertising.    Id.  at  904.    Concerned  about  the \\n\\nclaim submission rate, the trial court ordered further notice consisting of a targeted \\n\\nsocial media campaign, national radio campaign, e-mail notification, and additional \\n\\npostcards  and  posters.    Id.  at  905.    Ultimately,  22,000  claims  were  received \\n\\nrepresenting approximately 0.29 percent of the 7.5 million firearms at issue.  Id.  \\n\\nThe court placed the response rate in the context of the class settlement affording \\n\\nclass members benefits worth approximately $70.00, $12.00, or $10.00.  Id. at 904, \\n\\n906.  Given the exhaustive efforts at notice, notwithstanding the low response rate \\n\\n“the  notice  plan  was  adequate  and  satisfied  the  methods  and  mechanisms  for \\n\\ndisseminating notice set forth in” Rule 23.  Id. at 906-07.  These decisions show \\n\\nthat a response rate is relevant only secondarily to the examination of the notice \\n\\nthat  was  provided  in  the  context  of  the  possible  forms  of  notice  reasonably \\n\\navailable.   \\n\\nThe superior court focused on the adequacy of the notice plan, commenting \\n\\nat the final fairness hearing that “the thing that stands out to [the court] the most \\n\\nas being potentially deficient is the notice.”  In executing a notice plan using known \\n\\n20 \\n\\n\\x0cNo. 84910-7-I/21 \\n\\ne-mail  and  postal  addresses,  the  parties  appropriately  started  with  the  U.S. \\n\\nSupreme Court’s baseline rule requiring individual notice to class members who \\n\\ncan be identified through reasonable effort.  Eisen, 417 U.S. at 173.  Expanding \\n\\nthe notice plan, as well as evaluating the response rate, must take into account the \\n\\nfact the class is admittedly one that is difficult to reach,  and the extent to which \\n\\nadditional means of notice are available.  Here, the notice approved by the superior \\n\\ncourt  relied  additionally  on  the  Facebook  and  Instagram  posts,  the  settlement \\n\\nwebsite, and the toll-free telephone number.  Beyond these, Barnes points to the \\n\\npossibility  of  posting  notice  in  “ ‘homeless  shelters,  libraries,  and  transportation \\n\\ncenters,’ ” on a “ ‘city’s’ ” website, and direct distribution in person to the unhoused \\n\\npopulation.  However, all of these forms of notice—those that were used and the \\n\\nones  Barnes  urges—are  subject  to  the  limitations  inherent  in  notice  other  than \\n\\ndirect notice to the class member, as it is understood that “notice by publication or \\n\\nvia  the  Internet  tends  to  be  ineffectual  when  the  class  consists  of  consumers.”  \\n\\nPearson, 772 F.3d at 784.   \\n\\nThe notice plan heeded the concerns of Roes, 1-2 to do “more” than rely on \\n\\nmail alone,  by  using  known e-mail addresses,  online advertising,  and  a toll-free \\n\\nphone number to call.  The above decisions and our standard of review instruct \\n\\nthat,  provided  a  notice  plan  affords  individual  notice  to  members  who  can  be \\n\\nidentified  through  reasonable  effort,  it  is  within  the  superior  court’s  discretion  to \\n\\nassess the extent to which additional available means of notice must be employed \\n\\nto provide the best notice practicable under the circumstances.  This includes, and \\n\\nmay require, means of cumulative individual notice such as reminder notices and \\n\\n21 \\n\\n\\x0cNo. 84910-7-I/22 \\n\\nuse of e-mail in addition to first class mail, and means of non-individual notice such \\n\\nas advertising, general postings, or other community outreach.  Together with the \\n\\nsettlement anticipating and mitigating the difficulty of notice by providing for cy pres \\n\\nrelief, the superior court had a tenable basis to rule that the level of notice given in \\n\\nthis case was sufficient without additionally requiring further steps.  The superior \\n\\ncourt therefore did not abuse its discretion. \\n\\nC \\n\\nBarnes argues the settlement is not fair, reasonable, or adequate because \\n\\nthe settlement amount is inadequate, a circumstance Barnes ties to her argument \\n\\nthat  the  settlement  is  the  product  of  collusion  between  the  settling  parties.    We \\n\\ndisagree. \\n\\n“In class action cases, the courts have ‘an independent obligation to protect \\n\\nthe  interests  of  the  class.’ ”    Deien,  26  Wn.  App.  2d  at  65  (quoting  In  re  Nat’l \\n\\nFootball  League  Players  Concussion  Injury  Litig.,  821  F.3d  410,  430  (3d  Cir. \\n\\n2016)).    “Although  CR  23  is  silent  in  guiding  trial  courts  in  their  review  of  class \\n\\nsettlements,  it  is  universally  stated  that  a  proposed  class  settlement  may  be \\n\\napproved  by  the  trial  court  if  it  is  determined  to  be  ‘fair,  adequate,  and \\n\\nreasonable.’ ”  Pickett, 145 Wn.2d at 188 (quoting Torrisi v. Tucson Elec. Power \\n\\nCo., 8 F.3d 1370, 1375 (9th Cir. 1993)). \\n\\nThe superior court’s determination involves a balancing of several factors, \\n\\nincluding  \\n\\nthe  likelihood  of  success  by  plaintiffs;  the  amount  of  discovery  or \\nevidence; the settlement terms and conditions; recommendation and \\nexperience of counsel; future expense and likely duration of litigation; \\n\\n22 \\n\\n \\n\\x0cNo. 84910-7-I/23 \\n\\nrecommendation of neutral parties, if any; number of objectors and \\nnature of objections; and the presence of good faith and the absence \\nof collusion. \\n\\nPickett, 145 Wn.2d at 188-89.  This list of factors is not exhaustive and every factor \\n\\nwill not necessarily be relevant in every case.  Id.  However, the court’s “ ‘role in \\n\\nevaluating  a  proposed  settlement  must  be  tailored  to  fulfill  [these]  objectives.’ ” \\n\\nDeien, 26 Wn. App. 2d at 67 (alteration in original) (quoting Officers for Justice v. \\n\\nCivil Serv. Comm’n of City & County of San Francisco, 688 F.2d 615, 625 (9th Cir. \\n\\n1982)).    Courts  apply  “heightened  scrutiny”  when  “assessing  class  settlements \\n\\nnegotiated  prior  to  class  certification.”    Roes,  1-2,  944  F.3d  at  1048;  accord \\n\\nSullivan,  667  F.3d  at  319;  Mars  Steel  Corp.  v.  Cont’l  Ill.  Nat.  Bank  &  Tr.  Co.  of \\n\\nChicago, 834 F.2d 677, 681 (7th Cir. 1987); Weinberger v. Kendrick, 698 F.2d 61, \\n\\n73 (2d Cir. 1982).   \\n\\nIn reviewing a superior court’s determination of whether a class settlement \\n\\nwas  fair,  adequate,  and  reasonable,  we  apply  an  abuse  of  discretion  standard.  \\n\\nPickett, 145 Wn.2d at 191-92.  “Due to the consensual nature of settlements, the \\n\\ntrial court’s inquiry is ‘delicate’ and ‘largely unintrusive.’ ”  Deien, 26 Wn. App. 2d \\n\\nat 67 (quoting Pickett, 145 Wn.2d at 189, 35 P.3d 351).  Our task is even more \\n\\nlimited than that of the superior court.  Id.  In reviewing an order granting approval \\n\\nof a class settlement, we accord great weight to the superior court’s views.  Id.       \\n\\nBarnes  argues  that  Hall  and  Summers’s  counsel  engaged  in  a  collusive \\n\\neffort with Sea Mar to thwart Barnes’s effort to consolidate the actions, ultimately \\n\\narriving at a settlement that was not in the class’s interests.  Barnes points to the \\n\\nremoval  as  preventing  the  superior  court  from  reaching  her  first  motion  to \\n\\n23 \\n\\n \\n\\x0cNo. 84910-7-I/24 \\n\\nconsolidate.  The timeline rebuts Barnes’s theory of collusion.  Sea Mar received \\n\\nHall’s  first  discovery  requests  in  January  2022.    Sea  Mar  notified  HHS  of  the \\n\\nlitigation  and  sought  certification  of  immunity  under  the  PHSA  and  FSHCAA.  \\n\\nBarnes,  2022  WL  1541927  at  *1.    Then,  a United  States  attorney  filed  a  notice \\n\\nadvising the superior court that the United States was considering whether it would \\n\\nintervene  in  the  action.    Id.    These  actions  occurred  six  and  three  days, \\n\\nrespectively, before Barnes filed her motion to consolidate.  Sea Mar was already \\n\\npreparing to remove the six lawsuits to federal court before being served with the \\n\\nmotion to consolidate.  And even if Sea Mar had filed its notice of removal in bad \\n\\nfaith,  which  the  federal  court  never  found,  Sea  Mar  did  not  stipulate  to  remand \\n\\nHall’s  and  Summers’s  actions  until  after  the  magistrate  judge’s  report  and \\n\\nrecommendation, id., and Barnes’s action was remanded to state court allowing \\n\\nher to fully present her arguments in support of coordination in her second motion \\n\\nto consolidate filed on May 20, 2022.   \\n\\nBarnes  further  points  to  Hall  and  Summers  opposing  consolidation  and \\n\\nsettling unilaterally,  arguing  the  absence of  appointed  lead counsel undermined \\n\\nthe class’s negotiating position.  Lead counsel may be appointed by the trial court \\n\\nto  engage  in  settlement  negotiations,  and  that  responsibility  may  call  for \\n\\nappropriate  communication  with  other  counsel  representing  class  members.  \\n\\nBoesky, 948 F.2d at 1365.  In cases in which lead counsel has been appointed, a \\n\\ncourt may consider lead counsel’s communications with other counsel as a factor \\n\\nbearing on whether to approve a settlement.  Id.  At the same time, when reviewing \\n\\nrequests for approval of attorney fees, courts may conclude that counsel for other \\n\\n24 \\n\\n\\x0cNo. 84910-7-I/25 \\n\\nplaintiffs and class members may not merit compensation from a class settlement \\n\\nif their efforts did not “ ‘create, discover, increase, or preserve the class’s ultimate \\n\\nrecovery.’ ”  In re Volkswagen “Clean Diesel” Mktg., Sales Pracs. & Prods. Liab. \\n\\nLitig.,  914  F.3d  623,  644-45  (9th  Cir.  2019)  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted) \\n\\n(quoting  In  re  Cendant  Corp.  Sec.  Litig.,  404  F.3d  173,  197  (3d  Cir.  2005)).    It \\n\\nfollows  that  counsel  pursuing  a  putative  class  action  may  negotiate  a  proposed \\n\\nsettlement  with  the  defendant  without  involving  counsel  pursuing  other  actions \\n\\nagainst the defendant, subject to review under Pickett.     \\n\\nThe  court  appropriately  considers  “the  presence  of  good  faith  and  the \\n\\nabsence of collusion” in evaluating a class settlement.  Pickett, 145 Wn.2d at 188-\\n\\n89.  Barnes points to the danger of “a ‘reverse auction’—where ‘the defendant in \\n\\na series of  class  actions picks  the  most  ineffectual  class  lawyers  to  negotiate a \\n\\nsettlement with in the hope that the district court will approve a weak settlement \\n\\nthat will preclude other claims against the defendant.’ ”  Swinton v. SquareTrade, \\n\\nInc.,  960  F.3d  1001,  1005  (8th  Cir.  2020)  (quoting  Reynolds  v.  Beneficial  Nat’l \\n\\nBank, 288 F.3d 277, 282 (7th Cir. 2002)).  A “reverse auction” may be signaled by \\n\\nthe presence of suspiciously generous attorney fees, mendacity, or underhanded \\n\\nactivity.  See id. at 1005-06.  It may also be signaled by such behaviors as “ ‘a \\n\\nMachiavellian plan to undercut the movants’ negotiating position,’ ” such as in one \\n\\ncase,  “leaving  the  law  firm  that  first  filed  the  case  and  commencing  a  second, \\n\\ncompeting action.”  Id. at 1006 (quoting Tech. Training Assocs. v. Buccaneers Ltd. \\n\\nP’ship, 874 F.3d 692, 695, 697 (11th Cir. 2017)).   \\n\\n25 \\n\\n\\x0cNo. 84910-7-I/26 \\n\\nThe facts of Swinton are if anything more concerning than those presented \\n\\nhere, yet still the court did not find a collusive reverse auction.  In Swinton, a later-\\n\\nfiling class action plaintiff reached a settlement with the defendant.  Id.  The later-\\n\\nfiling plaintiff copied another plaintiff’s first-filed complaint, and the first filing plaintiff \\n\\nsought to intervene in the settling plaintiff’s action.  Id.  The proposed intervenor \\n\\ndefeated an arbitration defense in his first-filed action.  Id. at 1003.  The later-filing \\n\\nplaintiff never litigated the defendant’s arbitration defense, and did not complete \\n\\ndiscovery, but instead negotiated a class settlement.  Id. at 1006.   \\n\\nThere is a rough similarity between the settling plaintiff in Swinton evidently \\n\\nnot doing the work to defeat the arbitration defense and Hall and Summers here \\n\\nallegedly  not  aggressively  fighting  the  removal  to  federal  court  and  asserted \\n\\nimmunity  defense.   But  the  superior  court nevertheless  found the settlement  on \\n\\nbalance to be fair, adequate, and reasonable.  At  the final fairness hearing, the \\n\\nsettling  parties  denied  that  they  settled  due  to  a  compromise  for  the  alleged \\n\\nimmunity  defense,  and  the  superior  court  was  entitled  to  conclude  that  was \\n\\naccurate.  While there was risk of a reverse auction to the extent there is in any \\n\\ncase  in  which  multiple  proposed  class  actions  are  presented,  Barnes’s  lead \\n\\nargument  that  Sea  Mar’s  removal  to  federal  court  was  designed  to  frustrate \\n\\nconsolidation is not borne out by the record.  It further ignores that after remand \\n\\nBarnes had a full hearing on her motion to consolidate.  Barnes does not point to \\n\\nany other circumstances such as suspiciously generous attorney fees, mendacity, \\n\\nunderhanded activity, “Machiavellian” plans, or any other machinations suggesting \\n\\n26 \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cNo. 84910-7-I/27 \\n\\nanything other than evaluation of Hall and Summers’s proposed settlement on its \\n\\nmerits in relation to the class’s claims. \\n\\nBarnes  seeks  to  show  the  settlement  was  a  “ ‘weak’ ”  settlement,  and \\n\\nleverages her argument that it was borne of Hall and Summers’s counsel’s rush to \\n\\nsettle before potentially losing control in the consolidated proceeding that Barnes \\n\\nadvocated.  Barnes argues, “The only explanation for the inadequate Settlement \\n\\namount  is  that  Settling  Counsel  discounted  for  the  risk  of  not  being  appointed \\n\\ninterim  lead  counsel  and  for  Sea  Mar’s  immunity  defense,  which  was  easily \\n\\ndefeated  by  Barnes  and  the  other  Non-settling  Plaintiffs  prior  to  preliminary \\n\\napproval.”  But Barnes fails to support her argument that the settlement was “weak” \\n\\nwithout resort to speculation. \\n\\nThe parties agree the settlement here provides a fund up to approximately \\n\\n$3.66  per  class  member.    Barnes  argues  the  relevant  point  of  comparison  is \\n\\nwhether Social Security numbers were compromised and points to cases she says \\n\\nresulted in settlements of $17.82 per class member and $53.28 per class member \\n\\nin such cases, compared to settlements of $2.88 and $1.02 per class member for \\n\\nbreaches affecting only payment card information and website login credentials.  \\n\\nMeanwhile, in addition to the fact that less than a fifth of the class here had Social \\n\\nSecurity numbers compromised, Hall and Summers point to settlements, they say \\n\\ninvolving  compromise  of  Social  Security  numbers,  amounting  to  $0.90,  $0.76, \\n\\n$1.31,  and  $0.85  per  class  member.    However,  the  parties  do  not  provide  an \\n\\nadequate record supporting these data, and they do not attempt to explain why \\n\\nthese  cases  and  aggregate  settlement  figures  are  similar  or  dissimilar  for \\n\\n27 \\n\\n\\x0cNo. 84910-7-I/28 \\n\\nsettlement purposes to the claims advanced by the class.  This led the superior \\n\\ncourt to comment, “[I]t was somewhat disappointing to see that what should be a \\n\\npretty cut and dry factual matter about what other cases settled for seems to be in \\n\\ndispute  and  there  seems  to  be  some  claim  that  there  has  been  less  than \\n\\ntransparency on this issue.”   \\n\\nA proposed settlement is not judged against a hypothetical or speculative \\n\\nmeasure of what might have been achieved.  Officers for Justice, 688 F.2d at 625.  \\n\\nA possibility that the settlement could have been better does not mean it was not \\n\\nfair, reasonable, or adequate.  Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d 1011, 1027 (9th \\n\\nCir. 1998), overruling recognized on separate grounds by Castillo v. Bank of Am., \\n\\nNA, 980 F.3d 723, 729 (9th Cir. 2020).  The nature and claims of a particular class \\n\\nharmed by a data breach may differ from those of another class.  For instance, the \\n\\nclass action may be as broad as one “affecting the personal information of almost \\n\\n150 million Americans.”  In re Equifax Inc. Customer Data Sec.

(“T-Mobile” or “Defendant”), seeking \\n\\nmonetary damages, restitution, and/or injunctive relief for the proposed Class and Subclass, as \\n\\ndefined below. Plaintiffs make the following allegations upon information and belief, the \\n\\ninvestigation of their counsel, and personal knowledge or facts that are a matter of public record. \\n\\n1. \\n\\nThe release, disclosure, and publication of sensitive, private data can be \\n\\nI. \\n\\nINTRODUCTION \\n\\ndevasting. Not only is it an intrusion of privacy and a loss of control, but it is a harbinger of \\n\\nidentity theft: for victims of a data breach, the risk of identity theft more than quadruples.1 A data \\n\\nbreach can have grave consequences for victims for years after the actual date of the breach—\\n\\nwith the obtained information, thieves can wreak many forms of havoc: open new financial \\n\\naccounts, take out loans, obtain medical services, obtain government benefits, and/or obtain \\n\\ndriver’s licenses in the victims’ names, forcing victims to maintain a constant vigilance over the \\n\\npotential misuse of their information. \\n\\n2. \\n\\nWashington-based cellular provider T-Mobile markets itself as a sophisticated, \\n\\n16 \\n\\nreliable network provider that sets itself apart by its “100% customer commitment.”2 T-Mobile \\n\\n17 \\n\\nrepresents that “[a]t T-Mobile, privacy and security is of utmost importance,” and that the \\n\\n18 \\n\\ncompany “take[s] our customer and prospective customer privacy VERY seriously.”3 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n26 \\n\\n27 \\n\\n28 \\n\\n3. \\n\\nDespite this representation, T-Mobile seems incapable of adequately protecting \\n\\nthe information it maintains from and about its customers. On the very day that T-Mobile was in \\n\\ncourt seeking final approval of a $350 million settlement concerning its then most recent data \\n\\nbreach from the fall of 2021, T-Mobile announced a new and successive data breach that \\n\\nimpacted 37 million of its customers (the “2022 Data Breach”). \\n\\n1 Dave Maxfield & Bill Latham, Data Breaches: Perspectives from Both Sides of the Wall, 25 S.C.

Consequently, Plaintiffs \\n\\nand the other Class members will incur ongoing out-of-pocket costs for, e.g., purchasing credit \\n\\nmonitoring services, credit freezes, credit reports, or other protective measures to deter and \\n\\n15 \\n\\ndetect identity theft. \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n6. \\n\\nBy this Complaint, Plaintiffs seek to remedy these harms on behalf of themselves \\n\\nand all similarly situated individuals whose private information was accessed during the 2022 \\n\\n18 \\n\\nData Breach. \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n26 \\n\\n27 \\n\\n28 \\n\\nII. \\n\\nJURISDICTION, VENUE, AND CHOICE OF LAW \\n\\n7. \\n\\nThis Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \\n\\n§ 1332(d)(2)(A), as modified by the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (“CAFA”), 28 U.S.C. \\n\\n§ 1711, et seq., because at least one member of the Class, as defined below, is a citizen of a \\n\\ndifferent state than T-Mobile, there are more than 100 members of the Class, and the aggregate \\n\\n4 Will Feuer, T-Mobile Says hackers Stole Data onAbout 37 Million Customers in Breach, WALL ST.

(“T-Mobile”) is a Delaware corporation with its \\n\\nprincipal place of business in Bellevue, Washington. T-Mobile is a wireless network operator \\n\\nand the second largest wireless carrier in the United States. It provides wireless voice and data \\n\\nservices for approximately 105 million subscribers. \\n\\n59. \\n\\nIn the course of its business, T-Mobile collects names, phone numbers, Social \\n\\nSecurity numbers, physical addresses, driver’s license information, and other information from \\n\\nits customers and prospective customers. \\n\\nIV. \\n\\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \\n\\nA. \\n\\nT-Mobile failed to adequately protect customer data, resulting in the 2022 Data \\nBreach. \\n\\n1. \\n\\nThe 2022 Data Breach \\n\\n60. \\n\\nOn January 20, 2023, T-Mobile disclosed that two weeks earlier, on January 5, \\n\\n2023, it discovered that hackers gained access to customer information on November 25, 2022, \\n\\nwhich access continued for an unspecified period.6 T-Mobile disclosed that hackers may have \\n\\nobtained names, billing addresses, emails, phone numbers, birth dates, and account numbers, in \\n\\naddition to account specific information like the number of lines on the account and plan \\n\\nfeatures.7 \\n\\n61. \\n\\nT-Mobile explained that the stolen data was exfiltrated through an Application \\n\\nProgramming Interface (API). Using the API, the unknown hacker was able to access account \\n\\n6 Feuer, supra note 4. \\n\\n7 See id. \\n\\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 11 \\nCASE NO. 23-cv-00211 \\n011149-11/2181053 V2 \\n\\n1301 Second Avenue, Suite 2000, Seattle, WA 98101 \\n\\n(206) 623-7292 OFFICE     (206) 623-0594 FAX \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCase 2:23-cv-00211   Document 1   Filed 02/16/23   Page 15 of 53\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\ninformation. The data theft was apparently ongoing from on or about November 25, 2022, until \\n\\nT-Mobile discovered it on January 5, 2023, and shut it down withing 24 hours of discovery. \\n\\n62. \\n\\nThis is not T-Mobile’s first experience with a data breach—despite collecting \\n\\nprivate information from customers in the ordinary course of business, this marks at least the \\n\\nsixth breach for T-Mobile in the past four years. In August 2018, sensitive information for over \\n\\ntwo million T-Mobile customers was exposed.8 In November 2019, approximately one million \\n\\nT-Mobile users’ names, addresses, phone numbers, account numbers, rate plans, and customer \\n\\nproprietary network information was accessed by hackers.9 Less than six months later, in March \\n\\n2020, an unknown number of customers’ names, addresses, phone numbers, account numbers, \\n\\n10 \\n\\nrate plans and features, and billing information was accessed by hackers.10 Later that year, the \\n\\n11 \\n\\nprivate information of approximately 200,000 customers’ data was exposed in yet another \\n\\n12 \\n\\nbreach.11 And on the day that T-Mobile announced the 2022 Data Breach, its lawyers were in \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\ncourt seeking approval of a $350 million settlement stemming from a massive data breach in \\n\\n2021 that resulted in the theft of PII of over 50 million T-Mobile customers (the “2021 Data \\n\\n15 \\n\\nBreach”).  \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n26 \\n\\n27 \\n\\n28 \\n\\n63. \\n\\nAfter each of these breaches, T-Mobile reiterated that it takes the security of \\n\\ncustomer information seriously and reassured customers that it has “a number of safeguards in \\n\\nplace to protect customer information from unauthorized access,” going so far as to claim that: \\n\\n“Keeping our customers’ data safe is a responsibility we take incredibly seriously and preventing \\n\\n8 Alicia Hope, Second Data Breach in 2020 for T-Mobile Exposed Customer and Call-Related Information of \\n200,000 subscribers, CPO MAGAZINE (Jan. 11, 2021), https://www.cpomagazine.com/cyber-security/second-data-\\nbreach-in-2020-for-t-mobile-exposed-customer-and-call-related-information-of-200000-subscribers/. \\n\\n9 Dewin Coldewey, More than 1 million T-Mobile customers exposed by breach, TECHCRUNCH (Nov. 22, 2019), \\n\\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2019/11/22/more-than-1-million-t-mobile-customers-exposed-by-breach/. \\n\\n10 T-Mobile’s Data Breach Exposes Customer’s Data and Financial Information, SECURITY MAGAZINE (Mar. 6, \\n\\n2020), https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/91856-t-mobiles-databreach-exposes-customers-data-and-\\nfinancial-information. \\n\\n11 Hope, supra note 8.  \\n\\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 12 \\nCASE NO. 23-cv-00211 \\n011149-11/2181053 V2 \\n\\n1301 Second Avenue, Suite 2000, Seattle, WA 98101 \\n\\n(206) 623-7292 OFFICE     (206) 623-0594 FAX \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCase 2:23-cv-00211   Document 1   Filed 02/16/23   Page 16 of 53\\n\\nthis type of event from happening has always been a top priority of ours.”12 Further, T-Mobile’s \\n\\nPrivacy Notice reiterates the company’s purported commitment to securing customers’ data: \\n\\ntechnical,  contractual,  and  physical \\nWe  use  administrative, \\nsafeguards designed  to  protect  your  data.

The report attributes this to more people having \\n\\nbeen victims before, contributing to greater awareness and understanding that they may suffer \\n\\n17 \\n\\nlong term consequences from this type of crime.22 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n75. \\n\\nT-Mobile failed to protect and safeguard Plaintiffs’ and Class members’ private \\n\\ninformation, in fact failing to adhere to even its most basic obligations. As a result, Plaintiffs and \\n\\nClass members have suffered or will suffer actual injury, including loss of privacy, costs, and \\n\\n21 \\n\\nloss of time. \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n26 \\n\\n27 \\n\\n28 \\n\\nV. \\n\\nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \\n\\n76. \\n\\nPlaintiff brings this action as a class action under Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of \\n\\nCivil Procedure, on behalf of a proposed nationwide class (the “Class”), defined as: \\n\\n20 Eugene Bekker, What Are Your Odds of Getting Your Identity Stolen?, IDENTITYFORCE (Apr. 15, 2021), \\n\\nhttps://www.identityforce.com/blog/identity-theft-odds-identity-theft-statistics.  \\n\\n21 Id. \\n\\n22 Identity Theft: The Aftermath 2013, Identity Theft Resource Center, https://idtheftinfo.org/latest-news/72 \\n\\n(last visited Feb. 1, 2023). \\n\\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 15 \\nCASE NO. 23-cv-00211 \\n011149-11/2181053 V2 \\n\\n1301 Second Avenue, Suite 2000, Seattle, WA 98101 \\n\\n(206) 623-7292 OFFICE     (206) 623-0594 FAX \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCase 2:23-cv-00211   Document 1   Filed 02/16/23   Page 19 of 53\\n\\nAll natural persons in the United States whose Personally \\nIdentifiable Information was compromised as a result of the 2022 \\nData Breach. \\n\\n77. \\n\\nIn addition, the State Subclasses are each defined as follows: \\n\\nFlorida Subclass: All natural persons in the State of Florida \\nwhose Personally Identifiable Information was compromised as a \\nresult of the 2022 Data Breach. \\n\\nIdaho Subclass: All natural persons in the State of Idaho whose \\nPersonally Identifiable Information was compromised as a result of \\nthe 2022 Data Breach. \\n\\nKentucky Subclass: All natural persons in the State of Kentucky \\nwhose Personally Identifiable Information was compromised as a \\nresult of the 2022 Data Breach. \\n\\nNew Jersey Subclass: All natural persons in the State of New \\nJersey whose Personally Identifiable Information was \\ncompromised as a result of the 2022 Data Breach. \\n\\nNorth Carolina Subclass: All natural persons in the State of north \\nCarolina whose Personally Identifiable Information was \\ncompromised as a result of the 2022 Data Breach. \\n\\nTexas Subclass: All natural persons in the State of Texas whose \\nPersonally Identifiable Information was compromised as a result of \\nthe 2022 Data Breach. \\n\\n78. \\n\\nNumerosity and Ascertainability: Plaintiffs do not know the exact size of the \\n\\nClass or identity of the Class members, since such information is in the exclusive control of \\n\\nDefendant.

Plaintiffs are advancing the same claims and legal theories on \\n\\nbehalf of himself and all other members of the Class that they represent, and there are no \\n\\ndefenses that are unique to Plaintiffs. The claims of Plaintiffs and Class members arise from the \\n\\nsame operative facts and are based on the same legal theories. \\n\\n81. \\n\\nAdequacy: Plaintiffs are adequate Class representatives because their interests do \\n\\nnot conflict with the interests of the other members of the Class they seek to represent; Plaintiffs \\n\\nhave retained counsel competent and experienced in complex class action litigation; and \\n\\nPlaintiffs intend to prosecute this action vigorously.

CAUSES OF ACTION \\n\\nNEGLIGENCE \\n\\n83. \\n\\n84. \\n\\nPlaintiffs incorporate all foregoing factual allegations as if fully set forth herein. \\n\\nT-Mobile owed a duty to Plaintiffs and Class members, arising from the \\n\\nsensitivity of the information, the expectation the information was going to be kept private, and \\n\\nthe foreseeability of its data safety shortcomings resulting in an intrusion, to exercise reasonable \\n\\ncare in safeguarding their sensitive personal information. This duty included, among other \\n\\nthings, designing, implementing, maintaining, monitoring, and testing T-Mobile’s networks, \\n\\nsystems, protocols, policies, procedures, and practices to ensure that Plaintiffs’ and Class \\n\\nmembers’ information was adequately secured from unauthorized access. \\n\\n85. \\n\\nT-Mobile’s Privacy Notice acknowledged T-Mobile’s duty to adequately protect \\n\\nPlaintiffs’ and Class members’ PII. \\n\\n86. \\n\\nT-Mobile owed a duty to Plaintiffs and Class members to implement \\n\\nadministrative, physical, and technical safeguards, such as intrusion detection processes that \\n\\ndetect data breaches in a timely manner, to protect and secure Plaintiffs’ and Class members’ PII. \\n\\n87. \\n\\nT-Mobile also had a duty to only maintain PII that was needed to serve customer \\n\\nneeds. \\n\\n88. \\n\\nT-Mobile owed a duty to disclose the material fact that its data security practices \\n\\nwere inadequate to safeguard Plaintiffs’ and Class members’ PII. \\n\\n89. \\n\\nT-Mobile also had independent duties under Plaintiffs’ and Class members’ state \\n\\nlaws that required T-Mobile to reasonably safeguard Plaintiffs’ and Class members’ PII, and \\n\\npromptly notify them about the 2022 Data Breach. \\n\\n90. \\n\\nT-Mobile had a special relationship with Plaintiffs and Class members as a result \\n\\nof being entrusted with their PII, which provided an independent duty of care.

Moreover, T-Mobile was \\n\\ncapable of protecting its networks and systems, and the PII it stored on them, from unauthorized \\n\\naccess. \\n\\n91. \\n\\nT-Mobile breached its duties by, among other things: (a) failing to implement and \\n\\nmaintain adequate data security practices to safeguard Plaintiffs’ and Class members’ PII, \\n\\nincluding administrative, physical, and technical safeguards; (b) failing to detect the 2022 Data \\n\\nBreach in a timely manner; and (c) failing to disclose that its data security practices were \\n\\ninadequate to safeguard Plaintiffs’ and Class members’ PII. \\n\\n92. \\n\\nBut for T-Mobile’s breach of its duties, including its duty to use reasonable care \\n\\nto protect and secure Plaintiffs’ and Class members’ PII, Plaintiffs’ and Class members’ PII \\n\\nwould not have been accessed by unauthorized parties. \\n\\n93. \\n\\nPlaintiffs and Class members were foreseeable victims of T-Mobile’s inadequate \\n\\ndata security practices. T-Mobile knew or should have known that a breach of its data security \\n\\nsystems would cause damage to Plaintiffs and Class members. \\n\\n94. \\n\\nIt was reasonably foreseeable that the failure to reasonably protect and secure \\n\\nPlaintiffs’ and Class members’ PII would result in unauthorized access to T-Mobile’s networks, \\n\\ndatabases, and computers that stored or contained Plaintiffs’ and Class members’ PII. \\n\\n95. \\n\\nAs a result of T-Mobile’s negligent failure to prevent the 2022 Data Breach, \\n\\nPlaintiffs and Class members suffered injury, which includes, but is not limited to, exposure to a \\n\\nheightened and imminent risk of fraud, identity theft, and financial harm. Plaintiffs and Class \\n\\nmembers must monitor their financial accounts and credit histories more closely and frequently \\n\\nto guard against identity theft. Plaintiffs and Class members have also incurred, and will continue \\n\\nto incur on an indefinite basis, out-of-pocket costs for obtaining credit reports, credit freezes, \\n\\ncredit monitoring services, and other protective measures to deter and detect identity theft. The \\n\\nunauthorized acquisition of Plaintiffs’ and Class members’ PII has also diminished the value of \\n\\n27 \\n\\nthe PII. \\n\\n28 \\n\\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 19 \\nCASE NO. 23-cv-00211 \\n011149-11/2181053 V2 \\n\\n1301 Second Avenue, Suite 2000, Seattle, WA 98101 \\n\\n(206) 623-7292 OFFICE     (206) 623-0594 FAX \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cCase 2:23-cv-00211   Document 1   Filed 02/16/23   Page 23 of 53\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n26 \\n\\n27 \\n\\n28 \\n\\n96. \\n\\nThe harm to Plaintiffs and Class members was a proximate, reasonably \\n\\nforeseeable result of T-Mobile’s breaches of its aforementioned duties. \\n\\n97. \\n\\nTherefore, Plaintiffs and Class members are entitled to damages in an amount to \\n\\nbe proven at trial. \\n\\n98. \\n\\nPlaintiffs allege and incorporate the foregoing allegations as if fully set forth \\n\\nNEGLIGENCE PER SE \\n\\nherein. \\n\\n99. \\n\\nUnder the Federal Trade Commission Act (“FTCA”), 15 U.S.C. § 45, T-Mobile \\n\\nhad a duty to provide fair and adequate computer systems and data security practices to \\n\\nsafeguard Plaintiffs’ and Class members’ PII. \\n\\n100. \\n\\nIn addition, under state data security statutes, T-Mobile had a duty to implement \\n\\nand maintain reasonable security procedures and practices to safeguard Plaintiffs’ and Class \\n\\nmembers’ PII. \\n\\n101.

T-Mobile’s behavior establishes facts evidencing a reckless disregard for \\n\\nPlaintiffs’ and Class members’ rights. \\n\\n117.  T-Mobile, therefore, was grossly negligent. \\n\\n118.  T-Mobile’s negligence also constitutes negligence per se. \\n\\n119.  The negligence is directly linked to injuries. \\n\\n120.  As a result of T-Mobile’s reckless disregard for Plaintiffs’ and Class members’ \\n\\nrights by failing to secure their PII, despite knowing its networks, systems, protocols, policies, \\n\\nprocedures, and practices were not adequately designed, implemented, maintained, monitored, \\n\\nand tested, Plaintiffs and Class members suffered injury, which includes but is not limited to the \\n\\nexposure to a heightened, imminent risk of fraud, identity theft, financial and other harm. \\n\\nPlaintiffs and Class members must monitor their financial accounts and credit histories more \\n\\nclosely and frequently to guard against identity theft.

Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate the foregoing allegations as if fully set forth \\n\\nherein. \\n\\n124.  Plaintiffs and members of the Class, additionally and alternatively, allege that \\n\\nthey entered into valid and enforceable express contracts with T-Mobile. \\n\\n125.  Under these express contracts, T-Mobile promised and was obligated to: \\n\\n(a) provide services to Plaintiffs and Class members; and (b) protect Plaintiffs’ and the Class \\n\\nmembers’ PII. In exchange, Plaintiffs and members of the Class agreed to pay money for these \\n\\nservices. \\n\\n126.  Both the provision of services, as well as the protection of Plaintiffs’ and Class \\n\\nmembers’ PII, were material aspects of these contracts. \\n\\n127.  T-Mobile’s express representations, including, but not limited to, express \\n\\nrepresentations found in T-Mobile’s Privacy Notice, formed an express contract requiring T-\\n\\nMobile to implement data security adequate to safeguard and protect the privacy of Plaintiffs’ \\n\\nand Class members’ PII. \\n\\n128.  Alternatively, the express contracts included implied terms requiring T-Mobile to \\n\\nimplement data security adequate to safeguard and protect the confidentiality of Plaintiffs’ and \\n\\nClass members’ PII, including in accordance with federal, state and local laws, and industry \\n\\nstandards. \\n\\n129.  Consumers value their privacy, the privacy of their dependents, and the ability to \\n\\nkeep their PII associated with obtaining services private. To customers such as Plaintiffs and \\n\\nClass members, services that do not adhere to industry-standard data security protocols to protect \\n\\nPII are fundamentally less useful and less valuable than services that adhere to industry-standard \\n\\ndata security. Plaintiffs and Class members would not have entered into these contracts with T-\\n\\nMobile without an understanding that their PII would be safeguarded and protected. \\n\\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 23 \\nCASE NO. 23-cv-00211 \\n011149-11/2181053 V2 \\n\\n1301 Second Avenue, Suite 2000, Seattle, WA 98101 \\n\\n(206) 623-7292 OFFICE     (206) 623-0594 FAX \\n\\n \\n \\n  \\n\\x0cCase 2:23-cv-00211   Document 1   Filed 02/16/23   Page 27 of 53\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n26 \\n\\n27 \\n\\n28 \\n\\n130.  A meeting of the minds occurred, as Plaintiffs and members of the Class provided \\n\\ntheir PII to T-Mobile and paid for the provided services in exchange for, amongst other things, \\n\\nprotection of their PII. \\n\\n131.  T-Mobile materially breached the terms of these express contracts, including, but \\n\\nnot limited to, the terms stated in the relevant Privacy Notice. Specifically, T-Mobile did not \\n\\ncomply with federal, state, and local laws, or with industry standards, or otherwise protect \\n\\nPlaintiffs’ and the Class members’ PII, as set forth above. Further, on information and belief, T-\\n\\nMobile has not yet provided Data Breach notifications to some affected Class members who may \\n\\nalready be victims of identity fraud or theft or are at imminent risk of becoming victims of \\n\\nidentity theft or fraud associated with PII that they provided to T-Mobile. These Class members \\n\\nare as yet unaware of the potential source for the compromise of their PII. \\n\\n132.  The 2022 Data Breach was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of T-Mobile’s \\n\\nactions in breach of these contracts. \\n\\n133.  As a result of T-Mobile’s failure to fulfill the data security protections promised \\n\\nin these contracts, Plaintiffs and members of the Class did not receive the full benefit of the \\n\\nbargain, and instead received services that were of a diminished value to that described in the \\n\\ncontracts. Plaintiffs and Class members, therefore, were damaged in an amount at least equal to \\n\\nthe difference in the value of the secure services they paid for and the services they received. \\n\\n134.  Had T-Mobile disclosed that its security was inadequate or that it did not adhere \\n\\nto industry-standard security measures, neither Plaintiffs nor Class members, nor any reasonable \\n\\nperson, would have purchased services from T-Mobile. \\n\\n135.  As a result of T-Mobile’s breach, Plaintiffs and Class members suffered actual \\n\\ndamages resulting from the theft of their PII, as well as the loss of control of their PII, and \\n\\nremain in imminent risk of suffering additional damages in the future. \\n\\n136.  As a result of T-Mobile’s breach, Plaintiffs and the Class members have suffered \\n\\nactual damages resulting from their attempt to mitigate the effects of the breach of contract and \\n\\nsubsequent Data Breach, including but not limited to, taking steps to protect themselves from the \\n\\nloss of their PII. \\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 24 \\nCASE NO. 23-cv-00211 \\n011149-11/2181053 V2 \\n\\n1301 Second Avenue, Suite 2000, Seattle, WA 98101 \\n\\n(206) 623-7292 OFFICE     (206) 623-0594 FAX \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cCase 2:23-cv-00211   Document 1   Filed 02/16/23   Page 28 of 53\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n26 \\n\\n27 \\n\\n28 \\n\\n137.

Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate the foregoing allegations as if fully set forth \\n\\nherein. \\n\\n139.  Plaintiffs and Class members were required to provide their PII to obtain services \\n\\nfrom T-Mobile. Plaintiffs and Class members entrusted their PII to T-Mobile in order to obtain \\n\\nservices from them. \\n\\n140.  By providing their PII, and upon T-Mobile’s acceptance of such information, \\n\\nPlaintiffs and Class members on one hand, and T-Mobile on the other hand, entered into implied \\n\\ncontracts for the provision of adequate data security, separate and apart from any express \\n\\ncontracts concerning the services provided, whereby T-Mobile was obligated to take reasonable \\n\\nsteps to secure and safeguard that information. \\n\\n141.  T-Mobile had an implied duty of good faith to ensure that the PII of Plaintiffs and \\n\\nClass members in its possession was only used in accordance with their contractual obligations. \\n\\n142.  T-Mobile was therefore required to act fairly, reasonably, and in good faith in \\n\\ncarrying out its contractual obligations to protect the confidentiality of Plaintiffs’ and Class \\n\\nmembers’ PII and to comply with industry standards and state laws and regulations for the \\n\\nsecurity of this information, and T-Mobile expressly assented to these terms in its Privacy Notice \\n\\nas alleged above. \\n\\n143.  Under these implied contracts for data security, T-Mobile was further obligated to \\n\\nprovide Plaintiffs and all Class members with prompt and sufficient notice of any and all \\n\\nunauthorized access and/or theft of their PII. \\n\\n144.  Plaintiffs and Class members performed all conditions, covenants, obligations, \\n\\nand promises owed to T-Mobile, including paying for the services provided by T-Mobile and/or \\n\\nproviding the PII required by T-Mobile. \\n\\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 25 \\nCASE NO. 23-cv-00211 \\n011149-11/2181053 V2 \\n\\n1301 Second Avenue, Suite 2000, Seattle, WA 98101 \\n\\n(206) 623-7292 OFFICE     (206) 623-0594 FAX \\n\\n \\n \\n  \\n\\x0cCase 2:23-cv-00211   Document 1   Filed 02/16/23   Page 29 of 53\\n\\n145.  T-Mobile breached the implied contracts by failing to take adequate measures to \\n\\nprotect the confidentiality of Plaintiffs’ and Class members’ PII, resulting in the Data Breach. T-\\n\\nMobile unreasonably interfered with the contract benefits owed to Plaintiffs and Class members. \\n\\n146.  Further, on information and belief, T-Mobile has not yet provided Data Breach \\n\\nnotifications to some affected Class members who may already be victims of identity fraud or \\n\\ntheft, or are at imminent risk of becoming victims of identity theft or fraud, associated with the \\n\\nPII that they provided to T-Mobile. These Class members are unaware of the potential source for \\n\\nthe compromise of their PII. \\n\\n147.  The 2022 Data Breach was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of T-Mobile’s \\n\\nactions in breach of these contracts. \\n\\n148.  As a result of T-Mobile’s conduct, Plaintiffs and Class members did not receive \\n\\nthe full benefit of the bargain, and instead received services that were of a diminished value as \\n\\ncompared to the secure services they paid for. Plaintiffs and Class members, therefore, were \\n\\ndamaged in an amount at least equal to the difference in the value of the secure services they \\n\\npaid for and the services they received. \\n\\n149.  Neither Plaintiffs, nor Class members, nor any reasonable person would have \\n\\nprovided their PII to T-Mobile had T-Mobile disclosed that its security was inadequate or that it \\n\\ndid not adhere to industry-standard security measures. \\n\\n150.  As a result of T-Mobile’s breach, Plaintiffs and Class members have suffered \\n\\nactual damages resulting from theft of their PII, as well as the loss of control of their PII, and \\n\\nremain in imminent risk of suffering additional damages in the future. \\n\\n151.  As a result of T-Mobile’s breach, Plaintiffs and the Class members have suffered \\n\\nactual damages resulting from their attempt to mitigate the effect of the breach of implied \\n\\ncontract and subsequent Data Breach, including, but not limited to, taking steps to protect \\n\\nthemselves from the loss of their PII. As a result, Plaintiffs and the Class members have suffered \\n\\nactual identity theft and the ability to control their PII. \\n\\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 26 \\nCASE NO. 23-cv-00211 \\n011149-11/2181053 V2 \\n\\n1301 Second Avenue, Suite 2000, Seattle, WA 98101 \\n\\n(206) 623-7292 OFFICE     (206) 623-0594 FAX \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n26 \\n\\n27 \\n\\n28 \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cCase 2:23-cv-00211   Document 1   Filed 02/16/23   Page 30 of 53\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n26 \\n\\n27 \\n\\n28 \\n\\n152.

Plaintiffs and Class members entered into and/or were the beneficiaries of \\n\\ncontracts with Defendant, as alleged above. \\n\\n155.

Special relationships exist between Defendant and Plaintiffs and Class members. \\n\\nDefendant entered into special relationships with Plaintiffs and Class members, who entrusted \\n\\ntheir confidential PII to Defendant and paid for services with Defendant. \\n\\n157.  Defendant promised and was obligated to protect the confidentiality of Plaintiffs’ \\n\\nand Class members’ PII from disclosure to unauthorized third parties. Defendant breached the \\n\\ncovenant of good faith and fair dealing by failing to take adequate measures to protect the \\n\\nconfidentiality of Plaintiffs’ and Class members’ PII, which resulted in the 2022 Data Breach. \\n\\nDefendant unreasonably interfered with the contract benefits owed to Plaintiffs and Class \\n\\nmembers by failing to implement reasonable and adequate security measures consistent with \\n\\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 27 \\nCASE NO. 23-cv-00211 \\n011149-11/2181053 V2 \\n\\n1301 Second Avenue, Suite 2000, Seattle, WA 98101 \\n\\n(206) 623-7292 OFFICE     (206) 623-0594 FAX \\n\\n \\n \\n  \\n\\x0cCase 2:23-cv-00211   Document 1   Filed 02/16/23   Page 31 of 53\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n26 \\n\\n27 \\n\\n28 \\n\\nindustry standards to protect and limit access to the PII of Plaintiffs and the Class in Defendant’s \\n\\npossession. \\n\\n158.

As a result of Defendant’s breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair \\n\\ndealing, Plaintiffs and Class members did not receive the full benefit of their bargain—services \\n\\nwith reasonable data privacy—and instead received services that were less valuable than what \\n\\nthey paid for and less valuable than their reasonable expectations under the contracts. Plaintiffs \\n\\nand Class members have suffered actual damages in an amount equal to the difference in the \\n\\nvalue between services with reasonable data privacy that Plaintiffs and Class members paid for, \\n\\nand the services they received without reasonable data privacy. \\n\\n160.  As a result of Defendant’s breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair \\n\\ndealing, Plaintiffs and Class members have suffered actual damages resulting from the theft of \\n\\ntheir PII and remain at imminent risk of suffering additional damages in the future. \\n\\n161.  As a result of Defendant’s breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair \\n\\ndealing, Plaintiffs and Class members have suffered actual damages resulting from their attempt \\n\\nto ameliorate the effect of the 2022 Data Breach, including, but not limited to, taking steps to \\n\\nprotect themselves from the loss of their PII. \\n\\n162.  As a direct and proximate cause of Defendant’s conduct, Plaintiffs and Class \\n\\nmembers suffered injury in fact and are therefore entitled to relief, including restitution, \\n\\ndeclaratory relief, and a permanent injunction enjoining Defendant from its conduct.

Plaintiffs and Class members conferred a monetary benefit on Defendant in the \\n\\nform of monetary payments—directly or indirectly—for services received. \\n\\n165.  Defendant collected, maintained, and stored the PII of Plaintiffs and Class \\n\\nmembers and, as such, Defendant had knowledge of the monetary benefits conferred by \\n\\nPlaintiffs and Class members. \\n\\n166.  The money that Plaintiffs and Class members paid to Defendant should have been \\n\\nused to pay, at least in part, for the administrative costs and implementation of data management \\n\\nand security. Defendant failed to implement—or adequately implement—practices, procedures, \\n\\nand programs to secure sensitive PII, as evidenced by the 2022 Data Breach. \\n\\n167.  As a result of Defendant’s failure to implement security practices, procedures, and \\n\\nprograms to secure sensitive PII, Plaintiffs and Class members suffered actual damages in an \\n\\namount equal to the difference in the value between services with reasonable data privacy that \\n\\nPlaintiffs and Class members paid for, and the services they received without reasonable data \\n\\n14 \\n\\nprivacy. \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n26 \\n\\n27 \\n\\n28 \\n\\n168.

Defendant should be compelled to disgorge into a common fund for the benefit of \\n\\nPlaintiffs and the Class all unlawful or inequitable proceeds received by Defendant. A \\n\\nconstructive trust should be imposed upon all unlawful and inequitable sums received by \\n\\nDefendant traceable to Plaintiffs and the Class. \\n\\nDECLARATORY JUDGMENT \\n\\n170.

Plaintiffs and the Class have stated claims against Defendant based on negligence, \\n\\nnegligence per se, gross negligence and negligent misrepresentation, and violations of various \\n\\nstate and federal statutes. \\n\\n172.  Defendant failed to fulfill its obligations to provide adequate and reasonable \\n\\nsecurity measures for the PII of Plaintiffs and the Class, as evidenced by the 2022 Data Breach. \\n\\n173.  As a result of the 2022 Data Breach, Defendant’s system is more vulnerable to \\n\\nunauthorized access and requires more stringent measures to be taken to safeguard the PII of \\n\\nPlaintiffs and the Class going forward. \\n\\n174.  An actual controversy has arisen in the wake of the 2022 Data Breach regarding \\n\\nDefendant’s current obligations to provide reasonable data security measures to protect the PII of \\n\\nPlaintiffs and the Class. Defendant maintains that its security measures were—and still are— \\n\\nreasonably adequate and denies that they previously had or have any obligation to implement \\n\\nbetter safeguards to protect the PII of Plaintiffs and the Class. \\n\\n175.  Plaintiff seeks a declaration that Defendant must implement specific additional, \\n\\nprudent industry security practices to provide reasonable protection and security to the PII of \\n\\nPlaintiffs and the Class. Specifically, Plaintiffs and the Class seek a declaration that Defendant’s \\n\\nexisting security measures do not comply with their obligations, and that Defendant must \\n\\nimplement and maintain reasonable security measures on behalf of Plaintiffs and the Class to \\n\\ncomply with their data security obligations. \\n\\nB. \\n\\nClaims Brought on Behalf of the Florida Subclass \\n\\nVIOLATION OF THE FLORIDA DECEPTIVE  \\nAND UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES ACT, \\nFla.

T-Mobile’s representations and omissions were material because they were likely \\n\\nto deceive reasonable consumers about the adequacy of T-Mobile’s data security and ability to \\n\\nprotect the confidentiality of consumers’ PII. \\n\\n181.  Had T-Mobile disclosed to Plaintiffs and Subclass members that its data systems \\n\\nwere not secure and, thus, vulnerable to attack, T-Mobile would have been unable to continue in \\n\\nbusiness and would have been forced to adopt reasonable data security measures and comply \\n\\nwith the law. T-Mobile was trusted with sensitive and valuable PII regarding millions of \\n\\nconsumers, including Plaintiff and the Subclass. T-Mobile accepted the responsibility of \\n\\nprotecting the data while keeping the inadequate state of its security controls secret from the \\n\\npublic. Accordingly, Plaintiff and the Subclass members acted reasonably in relying on T-\\n\\nMobile’s misrepresentations and omissions, the truth of which they could not have discovered. \\n\\n182.  As a direct and proximate result of T-Mobile’s unconscionable, unfair, and \\n\\ndeceptive acts and practices, Plaintiff and Florida Subclass members have suffered and will \\n\\ncontinue to suffer injury, ascertainable losses of money or property, and monetary and non-\\n\\nmonetary damages, as described herein, including but not limited to fraud and identity theft; time \\n\\nand expenses related to monitoring their financial accounts for fraudulent activity; an increased, \\n\\nimminent risk of fraud and identity theft; loss of value of their PII; overpayment for T-Mobile’s \\n\\nservices; loss of the value of access to their PII; and the value of identity protection services \\n\\nmade necessary by the 2022 Data Breach. \\n\\n183.

T-Mobile’s representations and omissions were material because they were likely \\n\\nto deceive reasonable consumers about the adequacy of T-Mobile’s data security and ability to \\n\\nprotect the confidentiality of consumers’ PII.  \\n\\n260.  Had T-Mobile disclosed to Plaintiff and Subclass members that its data systems \\n\\nwere not secure and, thus, vulnerable to attack, T-Mobile would have been unable to continue in \\n\\nbusiness and it would have been forced to adopt reasonable data security measures and comply \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\nwith the law.  \\n\\n261.

Accordingly, Plaintiff and the Subclass members acted reasonably in relying on T-\\n\\nMobile’s misrepresentations and omissions, the truth of which they could not have discovered.  \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n26 \\n\\n27 \\n\\n28 \\n\\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 47 \\nCASE NO. 23-cv-00211 \\n011149-11/2181053 V2 \\n\\n1301 Second Avenue, Suite 2000, Seattle, WA 98101 \\n\\n(206) 623-7292 OFFICE     (206) 623-0594 FAX \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cCase 2:23-cv-00211   Document 1   Filed 02/16/23   Page 51 of 53\\n\\n262.  T-Mobile had a duty to disclose the above facts due to the circumstances of this \\n\\ncase, the sensitivity and extensivity of the PII in its possession, and the generally accepted \\n\\nprofessional standards. Such a duty is implied by law due to the nature of the relationship \\n\\nbetween consumers, including Plaintiffs and the Texas Subclass, and T-Mobile because \\n\\nconsumers are unable to fully protect their interests with regard to their data, and placed trust and \\n\\nconfidence in T-Mobile. T-Mobile’s duty to disclose also arose from its:  \\n\\na.  Possession of exclusive knowledge regarding the security of the data in its \\n\\nsystems;  \\n\\nb.  Active concealment of the state of its security; and/or  \\n\\nc.  Incomplete representations about the security and integrity of its computer and \\n\\ndata systems, and its prior data breaches, while purposefully withholding material \\n\\nfacts from Plaintiff and the Texas Subclass that contradicted these representations.  \\n\\n263.  T-Mobile engaged in unconscionable actions or courses of conduct, in violation of \\n\\nTex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann. § 17.50(a)(3). T-Mobile engaged in acts or practices which, to \\n\\nconsumers’ detriment, took advantage of consumers’ lack of knowledge, ability, experience, or \\n\\ncapacity to a grossly unfair degree.  \\n\\n264.  Consumers, including Plaintiff and Texas Subclass members, lacked knowledge \\n\\nabout deficiencies in T-Mobile’s data security because this information was known exclusively \\n\\nby T-Mobile. Consumers also lacked the ability, experience, or capacity to secure the PII in T-\\n\\nMobile’s possession or to fully protect their interests with regard to their data. Plaintiff and \\n\\nTexas Subclass members lack expertise in information security matters and do not have access to \\n\\nT-Mobile’s systems in order to evaluate its security controls. T-Mobile took advantage of its \\n\\nspecial skill and access to PII to hide its inability to protect the security and confidentiality of \\n\\nPlaintiff and Texas Subclass members’ PII.  \\n\\n265.  T-Mobile intended to take advantage of consumers’ lack of knowledge, ability, \\n\\nexperience, or capacity to a grossly unfair degree, with reckless disregard of the unfairness that \\n\\nwould result. The unfairness resulting from T-Mobile’s conduct is glaringly noticeable, flagrant, \\n\\ncomplete, and unmitigated.

T-Mobile acted intentionally, knowingly, and maliciously to violate Texas’s \\n\\nDeceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act, and recklessly disregarded Plaintiff and \\n\\nTexas Subclass members’ rights. T-Mobile’s numerous past data breaches put it on notice that its \\n\\nsecurity and privacy protections were inadequate.  \\n\\n267.

The  Court  will  establish  a  reappointment  application  process  at  an \\n\\nappropriate time in advance of the expiration date of the appointments in this Order. Applications \\n\\nfor  reappointment  will  detail  the  nature  and  scope  of  the  attorney’s  work  on  this  litigation, \\n\\nincluding the time and resources expended in the course of the previous year-long appointment.  \\n\\nThis Order shall not be interpreted as indicative of any decision relative to the issue of class \\n\\ncertification.  \\n\\nAll communications from Plaintiffs with the Court must be through Co-Lead Interim Class \\n\\nCounsel  or  Liaison  Counsel.
